pedestrians to cross north capitol to get to the bus stop on the southbound side between pierce and l the crosswalk is long and faded and drivers there move quickly and aggressivelythe only time i dont see drivers blocking the box here during pm rush is when ddot officers are present this intersection needs a serious redesignliterally no one obeys the school zone limit here there are two

approach this intersection much too fast many run red light others stop  block crosswalk part of problem is bad design roadway curves right before crosswalkpoorly timed signals cause traffic to back up blocking northside crosswalk  often the entire intersectiondrivers turning right from k st routinely ignore posted signage barring them from trying to continue west ie making lleft turn at light many others make illegal left turn from middle lanethe 15th street protected bike lane should be extended north from v st to columbia rd nw so that it is a twoway bike lane preferably protected many bicyclists go south the wrong way on that lane making it unsafe for all road usersmotorists on rock creek parkway often exceed the speed limit and harass cyclists who ride on the road instead of the jogging trailnorthbound motorists on 15th st often turn rightonred to rhode island ave without even slowing down very dangerous for all road users have never seen traffic laws enforced heredrivers on i street often think intersection is a four way stop and pull in front of cars going down 13th also difficult to see if traffic is coming on 13th from i so drivers roll into crosswalk endangering pedestriansthis is a very difficult intersection for pedestrians the signals favor cars on both 14th and independence and drivers routinely run red lights and block crosswalkspedestrians have a crosswalk here but cars turn right from constitution at high speeds cant see the pedestrians before they turn and do so in two lanes this turn should be eliminated cars can turn right at 18th stcars exit the parkway at high speeds a speed camera would be highly usefuldrivers ignore red turn arrow and turn onto vermont from circle often in the bike lanei work here and cross both of these streets at 9th  e nw several times a day often 13 cars pass through the red lights at each cycle in all directions ive had to warn guests to wait 35 seconds after the walk signal lightswide intersections at 17th and u allow cars to turn onto southbound 17th at speed with poor visibility of pedestrians parked cars close to the intersection often with odd angles due to extra space increase the problemuhaul often parks its trucks illegally along the street in the morning leaving just one lane for rush hour traffic traffic often backs up to the east as far as 2nd street nefrom duncan hard to see cars

trails in the areathis is a signed bike route but the road is too narrow for cars to pass bikers comfortably speeding cars often attempt unsafe passes or to intimidate bikers a protected bike lane would be idealcars always in the bike laneplease please continue the 14th st bike lane at least to florida its a steep downhill ride and cars take both lanes all the timecars just keep turning here blocking both bikes and pedestriansterrible connection from the end of the cycle track on g to columbus circle frequent conflicts between cyclists delivery trucks taxis and pedestrians exiting the metro station onto the narrow sidewalkvery difficult to cross florida using the crosswalks at m street  cars speed and rarely yieldone way sections of m make it hard to connect safely with the m

access the bus stopdrivers waiting to turn left from penn onto 15th try to go while cyclists have green light to proceed straight to 15th st cycletrack signal needs to have red left arrow added so that drivers have firm visual cuefolger theatre operates valet stands for events without proper permitting when doing so they frequently block both the bike lane and the auto lane causing cars and bikes to have to cross the double yellow to proceedthere are always cars in the bike lane along 4th st swthere is no reason for through traffic to stop at this light there are no pedestrian crosswalks or cross traffic present signal timing requires cars to sit at light while watching entire green phase cycle at the next light to turn onto 1st stcars on east capitol do not stop for pedestrians with the right of way at a minimum intersection should have a fourway stoppassing within 3 feet of cyclist taxicab headed south on taft bridgestop sign needed on montello heading southto cross florida between montello and 12th requires waiting for 3 different crosswalk signals at the same intersection the main signal cycle on florida only gives pedestrians 15 seconds to cross 4 lanes of trafficbuses block the crosswalk daily at rush hour force pedestrians into the interaction to get around themdouble parking on 12th street creates dangerous situations for bikers or cars attempting to travel throughdouble parking in front of the walmart needs to be enforced since it often aggravates the backups caused by the construction on mass3rdhspeeding remains a problem along florida even with the speed cameracars using west virginia as a cut through to and from new york frequently speedcars going northbound on 12th often try to beat the light as it changes posing a risk to cyclists and pedestrians crossing at edifficult turning on and off of g street from maryland for cyclists and carsi live on this block and i really think there should be a 4way stop sign here people think this is a 4way stop and there are so many close calls every day because people just stop and then roll through without looking it is very dangerousi occasionally see cars heading north on alaska think the eastbound green for kalmia is for them ive been inseen a few close calls where im heading east on kalmia on a green when someone heading up alaska enters the intersection on a redbikes proceeding on east capitol st must make a right turn and then move over two lanes to make the left around the park drivers frequently cut you off from behind intersection needs a bike box and signage to yield to turning bikesmotorists frequently fail to stop for pedestrians at all unsignaled crossing on the park including especially at this intersection where motorists turning right do not stop for pedestrians going straight on east capitalthe ped signal for crossing ny ave on east side of intersection is a deathtrapthe twoway protected bike lane on 15th ends here and forces bicyclists to move to the left side of the road to continue legally for one block where the one way north bike lane begins again on the hill the bike lane should not end thereconstruction is completely blocking the sidewalk on the west side of 20th st on for the southern half of the block between m st and n stdoubleparking in the bike lanes is rampant in front of the hotel here both for taxis and delivery trucks this forces cyclists out into traffic  unsafecars park illegally by the bikeshare docks and the bike racks this creates poor visibility for pedestrians and cyclists and forces southbound cyclists directly into oncoming car traffictwo lanes sebound on mass ave merge chaotically into one lane here pinching bicyclists and encouraging car drivers to speed and jockey for positiondouble parking on this block of penn is the rule not the exceptionto get from southside maryland ave ne into stanton park at 6th ne people on foot need to cross maryland ave ne which has a right turn only cycle 6th ne and c st ne which has a short pedestrian cycle stop all cars and let people walkpeople driving cars are speeding up rather than stopping at the cross walk bc it is just before they merge into 395 meanwhile it is the only way for families in sw to ride a bicycle over to the polo fields or the mt vernon trailspeeding vehicles on piney branch especially southbound often fail to yield to pedestrians crossing at dahlia also cars parked in front of the church obscure visibility of northbound vehicles for peds crossing from east to westthe cross walk button appears to be broken or it just takes way too longdrivers on c ne get a left arrow to turn onto 6th ne due to longer green cycles at c ne and maryland ave drivers run this red light frequently school park playground and library foot traffic are all affectedthe long wait to cross south capital street makes this route impossible to use in the morning when parents and kids are trying to ride bikes to schooldue to red light running and rightonred traffic the walk time crossing 6th between stanton park  mass ave is not enough for all walkers to safely cross many run surprising driversbike lane is too narrow  narrower than allowed under federal guidelines this makes it very difficult for cyclists to stay in the bike lane thus they often drift into the regular lane cars dont expect this since they a bike lane is thereevery day over a dozen people driving cars make an illegal left turn from 4th to m and almost hit people crossing the street there is no visible enforcement of the no left turn which is dangeroustour bus drivers often run people off the road when the are turning right from 4th to independence the drivers get much closer than 3 ft from the people on bikes on a regular basisthere is no marked path to go up the hill from this station and go towards the mall people on bikes end up using the cross marked area which is filled with double parked cars half the time it is very dangerousthe cross walk in front of the school is often blocked with people sitting in idling carscars turning north from new hampshire onto 22nd st constantly disregard pedestrians crossing with signal at nw corner of l and 22nd to nw corner of 22nd and new hampshire the signal allows the cars to go 1st but they dont stop turningi do not feel safe riding from union station to the mall people in cars drive too fast the bicycle lanes do not connect and the safe routes are blocked by barricades around the senate office buildingsthe cross walk takes forever to get from union station to f st and there is no direct cross walk so everyone jaywalks to get to f st this needs a redesignthe pedestrian signal on ct btw ordway and newark is great but you could grow old and die before the light changes so a lot of peds go ahead and jaywalkdouble parking and tourist buses jockeying for parking spaces in the west side parking lane makes this a very dangerous place to bike especially when drivers get frustrated with blocked lanesdrivers traveling eastbound on irving routinely bully their way through crossing pedestrians when turning southillegal parking in the bike lane which 311 refuses to enforce please see their seeclickfix app for proof that because there arent no parking signs here they wont enforce the no parking in bike lanes lawcars often park in the indent of the cycletrack on m street

eastbound on u to northbound on 16th or new hampshire often end up turning after their light has turned red during the bike green signal the bike green is too short to wait for left turning cars and then get safely throughcars fly along this residential block sometimes racing to catch the green light because its a residential street there are often pedestrians crossing midblock from parked cars or houses there are also many children aroundtraveling south on the west sidewalk of south capitol here is scary there is a ramp where cars could pull off the road at high speed and hit me but theyre coming from behind so its difficult to check the street before crossing heretwo lanes coming off of m st southbound share a light with traffic driving under m st on s capitol of these two lanes only the left most lane is able to continue onto s capitol while the right hand lane must turn right this is continually ignoredsouthbound 13th street is a very rough surface with numerous asphalt heaves this is a very dangerous intersection for bikers coming down the hillthere is not enough time to cross here at evening rush hour and the pedestrian signs only work if you push the button but it doesnt say that on the button signwhen it rains water often pool on this section of lincoln rd ne this causes drivers to try to drive around it often going into incoming cars lanelack of stop sign on 10th st in southbound direction creates unsafe situation for crossing pedestrians and trafficthere is not enough time to cross here and then you have to compete against all of the cars that are turning this is much worse because of the construction of the museum of african american history which has closed off the north sidewalktourist motor coaches regularly block the bike lanereally bad in the morning

hour they block the mixing zone forcing cyclists to maneuver into traffic and out of the protected cycle lane should just have a protected lane with no mixing zone and a green arrow for carsthis is a heavy pedestrian use area next to the lincoln memorial a tourist presses the walk button and wait an amazingly long time for the light to change sadly the out of town tourists run into the street rather than waitingit is impossible for a pedestrian to cross both east and west bound lanes of independence avenue in one light cycle unfortunately tourists frequently jay walk the vehicle traffic

inches away from the pedestrians i have never seen speed enforcement on this bridgethe biker specific light for bikers south bound on new hampshire seems to take forever even if parked in the signal

onto westbound g st se have a stop sign but rarely stop because theyre coming off a green light right before that at kentuckyto get from k street to washington circle you have to wait at four different lights and you have to zig zag back and forth in an irrational mannerthe service lane means that pedestrians have only a very short signal to cross ordway and go from the metro to the cleveland park shopping strip the direction traffic comes from is confusing and many cars speed to beat the long lightespecially bad in the afternoon trying to cross the south side of i stthe light

turns are permitted seen several near missesdrivers fly down 4th and cut across t many barely stop and most fail to look both ways for pedestrianscars headed west on north carolina to turn left onto

dont see the red light intended to stop wb fl ave traffic and allow peds to cross fl and eb ny ave traffic to turn onto fl wb many near misses at this confusing and dangerous intersectiontree boxes on k street south make the side walk extremely narrow and impassible for people with disabilities and children in strollerscrossing macomb on the west side of connecticut is too far cars speed down

ever get across in time because the light is shorttour buses unload here in the morning blocking the bike lanecars make illegal right on reds here almost ever single cycle they often dont even bother stoppingthe traffic lights here to continue north on overlook ave and ender jbab appear to be triggered for cars and without a car to trigger the light they do not give a green for bikers to continue onto the basethis intersection is too wide for pedestrians to cross safely and the signal cycle is unreasonably long cars frequently run the red light as a result and make illegal right on red turnsdrivers traveling from washington circle onto 23rd frequently run the red arrow or turn right on a red arrowin the evenings it can be difficult to see pedestrians who want to cross the street at the crosswalk if the curb protruded further into the street with no cars parked nearby it might be easier also more streetlightsthere are no bike lanes here so bikers have to ride in the shoulder on southbound overlook ave the shoulder goes out where the turn lane for nrl comes in frequently cars and buses cut in front of bikes to get into the turn lanevehicles block the bicycle lane and pedestrian crossing causing an unsafe circus for peds and bikerscars dont always stop for both pedestrians and cyclistsmorning and afternoon this intersection is dangerous for pedestrian drivers

entering freeway cross pedestrian crosswalk at highway speeds dangerous for pedersatiransdrivers regularly enter the intersection when it is obvious they will not be able to clear it before the light turns red they then block the box and crosswalksthe pedestrian walk signal is shifted to show walk when the actual signal should be stop its either on monroe park or maybe lamont very dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists who are following the pedestrian signalthe construction activities on 1st st are continuously blocking the bike lane without providing a safe alternativetour buses regularly block the metro bus stop on northbound connecticut ave after florida this forces metrobuses to pick updrop off from a lane of traffic which is an ada issue and a traffic safety issueintersection at school is dangeroussouthside sidewalk from 6th to 9th is impassible for those with accessibility issues the sidewalk is so narrow that any pedestrians on that side of street are in danger of being clipped by a side mirrorcars often aggressively pass bikes here trying to get onto the d st bike lanedangerous intersection with difficulty seeing pedestrians and few vehicles stop for them its a direct waking path to the metroand pedestrian cars use 6th st nw as a shortcut and have difficulty seeing bikes pedestrians and other cars when turning south or crossing onto butternut st nw deadending this street at butternut st nw would eliminate this unsafe intersectionspeeding along e capitol in front of school every morning from 710 am often recklessthe traffic lights here appear to

street at blair rd nwcars turning right from w on mass to n on new jersey often do not even slow to make right on red it is very dangerous for when cars take this corner at high speeds without looking for pedestriansthe crosswalks here are not signaled cars rarely stop for pedestrians the most problematic are cars using the protected rightturn from southbound overlook those turning right from the highway onto northbound overlookwhile there is a hawk signal here not enough pedestrians know how to use it more signs might helpthe alley entrance here is really really wide which encourages drivers to make turns across the sidewalk faster than is safelouisiana is the connection between the mbt1st st bike lane and the mall however speeding is so bad here that many bicyclists use the sidewalk instead of riding in 35 mph traffictrucks using the loading dock at this apartment building often block the crosswalk and sometimes the cycletrack as well pedestrians are forced to walk in the streetdouble parking is a big issue along this block it impedes traffic for both drivers and bikersthere are many nearmisses at this intersection drivers turning right from 15th onto constitution are impatient and squeeze through pedestrians crossing in the crosswalkpolice cars driving on the bike trail have ruined the sidewalk and create safety issue because bikes cannot see police cars on trail from fort totten dr ne please add bollards or other barrier to prevent illegal sidewalk driving by policedrivers coming out of the tunnel and turning right onto constitution frequently fail to yield to pedestriansdrivers never stop for this cross walk i have to start crossing and just hope someone slams on brakes and be ready to jump back if they dont lots of moms with strollers or toddlers use this crosswalk to get to bus stopslong distance to cross for pedestrians and drivers on 4th st making the island at allison st larger would help as would bump outs at the painted pedestrian crossing both could be done with out effecting parkingimpossible to see cars coming from either direction because of the street parking on nh ave thats spans all the way up to the intersection with crittenden there should be a larger noparking buffercyclist constantly run this light when southbound on 11th st and its impossible to see the traffic entering from the northeast on vermont ranges from merely rude to very dangerous based on whether anyone is coming how fast etcdrivers heading south on 18th and turning left act very aggressively towards pedestrians in the crosswalk with the right of waycould use contraflow lane to connect to the driveway just to the east of here cyclists often ride against traffic because the sidewalk is full of people obviously an issue at certain times of year more than otherswhen the white house complex is closely for security it is difficult for people on bikes to access the 15th st cycle track adding 2 short cycle tracks on h st nw and 15th st nw would help immenselypedestrians going north crossing massachusetts are often cut off by cars making a right turn on red from 17th to mass even though pedestrians have a walk signal and the cars will later have their own green turn arrownearly every block of the 5th st bike lane between the circle and rock creek church road has a giant run running through it numerous potholes debris from a lack of street sweeping on 5th ave cyclist have to weave in and out of traffic lanedrivers routinely floor is to go down this long block that has wide lanes and minimal street parking its difficult to parallel park pull in or out of the local business driveways or cross as a pedestrian needs a speed hump crosswalkone of the most dangerous intersections in the city drivers frequently ignore pedestrians in the crosswalk and drive right throughred lights along this stretch of 4th street are poorly times most mornings i get caught at every light between the mall and m st sw i bike south in the morningthe driveway is twice as wide as the alley itself cars treat this like a freeway onramp which is unsafe the driveway was also repaved and has this awkwardly steep angle on one section so this part could just be totally removedive crossed this intersection everyday for years and not once seen a driver yield for pedestrians at the crosswalkjbab has decided to use automatic gates that will not detect bikes this forces bikers to enter using the pedestrian gate and then reenter traffic on the other sideso much speedingsometimes pedestrians have to wait a minute or more for cars to stop here and even when southbound cars get caught at the light with georgia ave drivers pile into the crosswalk leaving tiny spaces for pedestrians to scoot throughspeeding erratic driving no enforcement someone was killed here recently still nothinglots of foot traffic at this intersection crossing lincoln on u st headed tofrom bloomingdale shops cars on lincoln tend to fly through the intersection trying to make the light at ri and dont see pedestrians until its late to slow downu street from 16 to 9 sure would make a nice pedestrian mallimpossible for a car exiting this alley to see traffic thats coming down gallatin from across new hampshire there should be no street parking between the alley and the light on the north side of the streetlots of foot traffic at this intersection crossing n cap on ri ave headed tofrom bloomingdale shops its an unpleasant intersection  ive had several near misses with cars racing to make left turns from ri to n cap accidents are too common herewalking underneath the underpass is frightening but the only way to get tofrom the shops at ri row from eckington the sidewalk is very narrow its dark and cars go through at ridiculously high speedsthe crosswalk light and street light are timed so pedestrians heading from the mass ave corner to the island are forced to cross when oncoming traffic has a green light drivers behave aggressively especially during rush hoursewer drain is entirely blocked by dirt and debris so when it rains the whole street is flooded and pedestrians or wheelchair users cannot cross at ne corner of 17  n sts nwthere are two lanes of eastbound q street west of massachusetts avenue both with straight arrows painted on the pavement cars in the left lane often turn right onto massachusetts avespace is tight especially when the bushes have not been trimmed could use a wider path to avoid bikebike conflictsmany red light runners on southbound 16th street or from colesville road at the north portal drive intersectionpeople use the bike lane as their personal valet service on this block of upshurdangerous to ride on the sidewalkpath sometimes especially during summer but also feels dangerous to many to ride with traffic on the street between the 15th st cycletrack and 14th st bridgecrossing piney branch rd nw is difficult here because the pedestrian signal is not automatic you have to see the sign telling you that you must push the button even if you push the button cars frequently ignore it and even honk at peds in crosswalvalet drop off for school kids blocked bike lanes cars also failed to yield for pedestrians and bikes in the crosswalk or turning onto the trail not sure if they had proper permitsthe pedestrian crossing signal runs on a very long cycle at georgia and otis nw if you do not catch it at the right part of the light cycle it can seem to take a very long time to get a walk sign encouraging pedestrians to disregard the signalfast and impatient cars and rapid light sequencing pushes bikers to the sidewalk posing conflicts between bikers and walkersno way for bikers or pedestrians to crosspolice cars frequently drive on multiuse trail as shortcut to their police station they are not authorized to do and are breaking the law please add bollards to prevent thislight is timed to give peds only about 8 seconds to cross ri aveno way to get from the mt vernon trail to the north side of memorial bridge there is a wornin trail but the park service keeps blocking it fix the issuecars make a right onto ri ave from 4th without yielding to pedestrians there is a daycare on this corner which compounds the dangers herefrequently illegal parking often by police officers eating lunchcrossing 15th on the south side of w allows for 21 seconds of crossing time every 120 i walk very fast and i can still barely cross 15th in 21 secondstoo much double parking discourages bikes from using this street many illegal parkers are police carscars frequently fail to stop for pedestrians in the crosswalk because they cannot see them until it is too latewould be nice to have visual cue about how bicyclists should be traveling to connect between sections of the cycletrack currently dangerous for peds and bikes through the plaza arealafayettecars frequently park and double park to pick up passengers from the metro please add a cycle track and a 15 minute parking laneeastbound m st traffic turning onto key bridge nearly always runs the red light its because drivers drive too fast and the lights are hard to seecars frequently double park to drop off people at the metrothis intersection in front of georgetown university is a mess too many drivers stand in random places picking up or dropping of passengers while blocking traffic meanwhile pedestrians and bikers have to try and wiggle themselves between the carsbike lanes frequently blocked with no enforcementthe curb cut on the northwest corner of this intersection sticks out really far and it looks like the right lane of nwbound mass ave is too narrow drivers routinely clip the curb and nearly hit pedestrians standing at the edge of the sidewalktry turning left from eastound pa ave onto the l st bikelane i have no clue how to do that safely drivers speed down pa ave and as a biker i have to get to the left lane to get onto l stdrivers on 12th routinely speed through this intersection weave around each other speed up when the light turns yellow and fail to yield to pedestrians when turning left onto i stbicyclists on t street constantly running through 4way stop sign despite limited visibility due to parked vehiclespotholes and road irregularities pose serious cycling riskslack of stop signs wide lanes and unused parking lanes encourage speeding on this section of interim metropolitan branch trailcyclists often speed down sidewalk going downhill and fail to yield to pedestrianscars frequently make illegal right on red turns despite poor visibility due to hill and bikers using interim mbtthis is one of the many many terribly designed dc intersections i know its been redone recently but it did not get better drivers speed and its utterly unclear where people are goingcars go super fast down 400500 kenyon and irvingvery difficult crossing as a pedestrian being seen need clear designated cross time or perhaps diagonal crossing and more time for pedsbikesbike lane ends before intersection which encourages drivers to encroach on bikers space please add bike lane through this stop sign and add bollard protectiontraveling eastbound on princeton to make a right onto park place  with cars parked on street it is difficult to see oncoming traffic and cyclists unless you pull through the crosswalk and well into the bike lanehard for a car turning from quincy st to rock creek church rd to see cars coming down the hill to their left due to onstreet parkingpedestrian signals are out of sync between the two 24th st nw crossings at the intersection with connecticut ave nw this often leads to pedestrians getting stuck in the middle of the intersection or jaywalkingwamta buses often block the bike lane this means that bikers needs to merge with drivers in a dangerous and chaotic intersectionthe entire l st bike lane is a disaster because it is on the left side of the road it leads to conflicts with drivers at every intersection furthermore many drivers park in the bike laneplease close this street access to fort totten dr ne cars use this cut through to access fort totten dr ne at bikerdriver expense already on street cars cannot see bikescarspeds on street and pull out blindly causing many near missescars consistently do not stop for pedestrians and are often hostile toward pedestriansthe ellipse could be a beautiful park for pedestrians with nice bike lanes instead it is a overflow parking lot for the white house booovery very scary intersection to crosspolice cars frequently double park in front of their station it is hard to enforce something if the enforcers are breaking the law toosignal cycle is too biased towards cars coming off the highway and is not long enough for more than 23 cars on 5th st se to cross long signal times encourage bikers to run red lightthis whole intersection is difficult to bike on the sidewalk because some lines of sight are poor and some righthooks the result is very unpredictable moves from both runners and bikersthis signal takes too long and as a result many pedestrians and bikes cross against the lightsignificant rat infestation next to bus stop on south side of massachusetts trash cans exacerbate problempedestrians need a crosswalk somewhere between i and m streetcommuters are backed up on north capitol and use adams and bryant streets to get around the traffic with construction the speed limit is 15mph however cars routinely speed through on their commutes in the morningvehicles often run the red light especially travellling north at this intersection often almost hitting pedestrains who have started to crossparking is allowed next to this crosswalk but the parked cars make it difficult to see whether a pedestrian is waiting to cross the parking spot should be removed which would allow bikers and drivers to better see pedestrians and to stop for themcars often fail to notice the midblock crosswalk with traffic light and drive straight through red lightsthere is so much illegal parking all around judiciary square many of the cars claim to have something to do with the police the put placards or hats on the dashboard its really quite shocking that this is permittedusps vehicles often double parked blocking the right lanedelivery trucks often parked in front of cvsi have repeatedly seen cars parked illegally on this bridge over the freeway although they are not cop cars they usually have some indication that they belong to a cop or a cops family member so thats probably why they are not ticketed bsbike lane disappears cars want tu turn right onto 695 danger to bikers in morning rush houradding a bike lane to columbia road would help to cut down on the wrongway riding that necessarily occurs on the sidewalk nowi have nearly been hit numerous times by drivers turning left while in the crosswalk walking across florida ave towards gallaudet its a dangerous intersection for pedestrians a left turn only arrow would be very helpful herethe wait to cross over 4th street is very long and then when the light does change it is too shortintersection should have crosswalk at every crossing pointdrivers

columbia road regularly blow through the stop signs at this intersection it is very dangerous for pedestriansmid block cross walk going southbound drivers speed up after passing the traffic light at u and 14 and often times do not see the mid block cross walk to reduce their speed or slow downthe two ped signals for crossing the westbound  eastbound lanes of ny ave arent synced well going south forcing people to crowd in the median to wait for the second walk sign also confuses drivers who have a green arrow but think they must yieldthe construction activity at the corner of new jersey and i has blocked view of the stop signs and covered up the crosswalks this interesection is now very dangerous to cross in all directionsthere should be a crosswalk across 6th street from on the north side of this intersectionthere is no crosswalk on the south side of windom this forces all pedestrians to walk to the north side this is especially problematic given the nearby metro entrance closure and sidewalk closurebroken curbs and no crosswalk ramps make for a difficult crossing to the playgroundshort pedestrian signal on sb side of washington ave sw with left turns now being permitted from wb independence ave sw makes this a dangerous mess whole intersection really needs to be reworked given additional turning movements allowed nowbroken curbs are a hazard when parking cars the street basically disappears into the grass along this block with pieces of broken pavement laying in the roadhigh pedestrian traffic area between gallaudet university and union market multiple failures of motorists to stop for pedestrians also speedingat this unsignaled crosswalk back from the intersection cars frequently fail to stop for pedestrians despite presence of signs indicating they must do so greater visibility for pedestrians or some actual enforcement of traffic laws pleasevery unsafe crossingalmost all other intersections in the area are 4way stops which creates confusion at this 2way stop also its hard to see traffic crossing in both directionseveryone treats the stop sign as a yielddifficult to see nh ave traffic on both sides of emerson st the angle of traffic makes visibility difficult parking on nh needs to be moved back to allow a better field of visionpavement is poor and tight many dump trucks and cars pass too close to cyclists this is supposed to be the temporary mbtthe new traffic lights here southbound on 5th are terrible  its impossible to tell if the light is green yellow or red doesnt this defeat the purpose of having a traffic light in the first placetraffic often backs up in the evenings especially when cars traveling north are trying to turn left cyclists with room to pass traffic on the right are routinely in danger of cars trying to pass the vehicle turning left or cars turning rightthere isnt a stop sign at this intersection going northsouth on 6th street leading to cars going high speeds in that direction as a pedestrian and bicyclist going down a this can lead to a pretty hazardous situationto cross connecticut ave at windom pedestrians must engage a beg button and wait for the light to change the crossing light then lasts 20 seconds hundreds now cross daily to get tofrom the metro from the northdrivers regularly park in the no parking zone on nb connecticut ave after dupont circle when they do this buses cannot make the turn from the circle to connecticut and it backs up traffic once it was a park police officer getting coffeecars routinely run the stop sign here to make it onto michigan ave its just a confusing intersection for all parties involvedthe service lane along connecticut ave creates carpedestrian conflicts and leaves little room on the sidewalk for pedestriansit is very difficult to cross michigan ave ne at these crosswalks because cars speed along the street and dont stop for pedestrianscars move way too fast down this streetlarge amount of cutthrough car traffic plus pedestrians crossing plus bicycle traffic makes this a very dangerous intersection when those cars then do not stop completely and often ignore rightofway rules which is often especially rush hoursthe double parkingvalet parking on northbound connecticut ave before dupont circle needs to be stopped it is nearly impossible for cars to get into the lanes that go to dupont circle in the eveningcars turning onto taylor street from 7th or puerto rico often have to wait a very long time for a green light sometimes the light turns red for taylor street drivers but doesnt turn green for taylor and puerto ricothis intersection is confusing and poorly designed especially for those driving westbound on u street i rarely see other cars actually using the correct lanes to turn get to florida ave or 18th stvisibility is poor on all intersections involving angled streets parking needs to be moved further up the street so crossing vehicles can see oncoming traffic without inching into the lanethe bus lane markingssigns should be eliminated this is not enforced at all  there are just as many cars in the bus lane as the other lane all it does it teach drivers to ignore bus lanesbroken curbs and no crosswalk ramps make for a difficult crossing to the parkthe nw corner of connecticut and albemarle has been rounded to effectively make the road four lanes wide compared to 3 lanes wide on the east side this encourages sb drivers on connecticut to make wide turns or wb albemarle traffic to speedcars block this entire intersection every afternoon forcing cyclists and pedestrians to try to weave their way through them and blocking oncoming car traffic entirelyheading south bike lane disappeared two blocks before and bikes sharing full lane shared lane turns into a right turn lane this is a problem for bikers heading straight south on 11th stlarge generator on a trailer partially blocks crosswalk and limits line of sight has been in place for several monthsfor some reason the crosswalk across the east side of i st where it intersects with 22nd was jackhamered up and there are no crossing signs people still cross there everyday because its a logical place to cross the

a dogdelivery trucks block the entire sidewalk forcing pedestrians into the street near an intersection where cars turn too fast to see themthere is a chronic problem of cyclists riding on the

pedestrians waiting to cross to the stadiumarmory metro stationcyclists often ride counterflow along this stretch of the r street bike lane between mass ave and 21st street this puts the wrongway cyclist in dangerpeople blow through these stop signs a lot either trying to avoid traffic by zooming down nicholson st or trying to make the light at 5th and missouri there are many small children in the areaa connection to the mbt here would make for a better walk to the metro from this areano safe way to cross this bridge on a bike the sidewalk is narrow and in poor repair the roadway has heavy traffic that seldom notices cyclistscyclists ride against the oneway westbound traffic flow typically in the oneway westbound bike lane this endangers all road users often causing conflict between

cleaned upbike lanes here are often strewn with gravel glass and trash making them unsafecrossing lanes eb pennsylvania ave on south side of potomac ave is a long wait for a very short signal and is a frequent source of conflict with drivers turning right from potomac onto pennsylvania as well with the short signal timea small  of drivers do not seedo not understand the turning arrow to make a left

lane space heading into thomas circle they regularly veer into the bike lane even when bikes are presentthe sidewalk is broken here and has been repaired but the repairs have worn away so that there are large holes where there is no concrete or asphalt this makes passage difficult for those in wheelchairs or those on bicyclestoo many cars in the bus and bike laneevery evening this intersection is blocked with cars going down florida there needs to be clear lines where to stop at the floridai storren light to prevent trafficcars illegally park too close to the crosswalk blocking the line of sitecars tend to speed up to make it through this intersection and have nearly been hit several times when i had a cross signal it doesnt help that the signal to cross this street is shortthis is an incredibly dangerous intersection for pedestrians due to the combination of a wide turning radius freeway type speeds on 17th and the lack of a no turn on red sign for traffic on 17th it needs bulbouts no turn on red signbicyclist do not stop at the sign coming southbound on 11th st or eastbound on t its dangerous for both pedestrians and carscars turning right from 17th onto potomac do not slow down and to do not stop before turning right on red even when pedestrians are presentconstant speeding on this stretch of kennedy street nw a stop sign at 1st st nw and kennedy street nw could help curb this behaviorvehicular traffic going west on kennedy street nw have a terrible intersection at missourikansas avenues to merge into cars frequently speeding down missouri ave and weaving in

avenue intersection is a pedestrian cyclist and vehicular nightmare if the medians were removed and kennedy street was continuous many accidents and nearmisses could be avoidedthe plastic bollards do not continue all the way to the intersection so cars are constantly pulling into the bike lane when trying to park in the angled spaces at the end of the row a white van has almost hit me numerous timesred light running is rampant at this intersection even when pedestrians are waiting to crossbecause of speed along irving street and poor visibility cars have to edge into traffic to see if they can turn left a mirror or stop sign would help although because of irving street classification additional stop signs may not be warrantedit is very difficult to cross this intersection on foot as the

the ped signal is timed on the east side of 6th street its almost impossible to get all the way across penn ave with kids then youre stuck in the median with kids who could easily run offcars and bikes dont know how they are supposed to share the road here when heading south up the hill given that bikers generally are heading straight and so should be in the left lane but they are inclined to stay rightthis road is harrowing for bikers because drivers try to pass even with very limited visibility the biggest danger to cyclists is a headon collision right in front of them due to this unsafe behaviormany drivers either dont notice or disregard the midblock traffic light on 18th street between k and l also the road surface here is an embarrassment for any civilization that considers itself advancedon this steep hill i generally bike at least 25 mph but cars still attempt to pass at fast speeddeveloper blocks sidewalk on the south side of v street and no longer provides a protected

light turning onto whitehavenpeople routinely park along the sidewalk bulb out making it difficult for 2 lanes of traffic to pass ive even seen someone get sideswiped here one time because they were parked poorlythe crosswalk on the west side of this intersection has only ten seconds to cross a relatively wide stretch of c street this is a fraction of the 20 seconds available to pedestrians on the east side of the intersectionwhile there are crosswalks there are no stop signs this is confusing to pedestrians and drivers alike as they subconsciously assume that e street traffic will stop at 23rd placeentrance to alley and all of the wylie st alley streets are crumbling pot holes continue to show up and city and work vehicles are main contributors to this you cannot drive or walk safely due to the condition of the streets they must be repairedstreets on wylie st east of 13th street  are in really bad shape i tripped and fell and there is gravel everywherecars on 6th st nw are usually backed up and will run the light to cross ny ave nw when crossing 6th st as a pedestrian cars trying to make a left turn from ny ave nw have difficulty spotting pedestrians who are crossing 6thmany people cross diagonally here cars from ny ave nw have difficulty spotting pedestrians due to many improperly parked vehicles that reduce visibility of sidewalks and peoplethe redlight at windom and conn heading northbound on conn is hard to see causing drivers to run the redlightpedestrian signal timers are routinely hit by trucks turning from ny ave nw onto 1st st nw timers have always been hit and turned askew therefore not visible to pedestrians submitted multiple 311 tickets they get fixed and routinely hit againtoo long of a wait for pedestrians to cross ny ave also very dangerous with cars running red lights to avoid waiting longer to get onto 395drivers frequently speed when approaching right turn onto franklin st ne often not seeing pedestrians til the last minute due to a big tree blinding the pedestrian crossing and speedingshould be a fourway stop difficult sight lights for drivers on legation attempting to cross 31st street there have been multiple accidents in the pastpedestrian signal installed upside downmotorists exiting office building make illegal left turn up oneway street to use the buildings back alley as a shortcut to northbound 3rd street se the

the parking line is rounded so drivers think if they are partially within that rounded space theyre okconfusing  some 19th st vehicles stop even though they dont have a stop sign some t st vehicles  pedestrians assume 4way stop and cross in front of 19th st vehicles also poor visibility southward for eastbound pedestrians due to parked carsconfusing intersection because westbound florida light stays green 15 seconds longer than eastbound florida light pedestrians see one red light and start to cross not clear how it helps traffic flow to have mismatched signal timingvery difficult to cross

stopping for pedestrians cyclist crossing sousa bridge ddot could start by restriping crosswalks then some enforcement by mpdalabama ave se at all marked intersections between 30th st and branch ave cars do not stop for pedestrians need flashing lights and enforcementthere is a lot of people crossing in the middle of the block and using the bike lanes as a hang out while waiting for traffic to clearmany drivers run the red light in the slip lane from k street to connecticut northbound by treating it like a right on red this is a very unsafe situation given all of the pedestrians coming from the farragut metro exit at this cornerdrivers regularly run the red turn arrow from 18th onto l streetright lane should be straight only at this light and left lane should be for all left turns cars turning left from both lanes frequently conflict over which lane theyre turning intocars rushing to make the green light at 11th frequently fail to yield to pedestrians all of these crosswalks should be protected with stop signs several could also use revised parking for better sight linesthe turn signals from m st onto 4th st are in an unusual cycle and are hard to see by pedestrians pedestrians see the do no walk sign but see the light is red and attempt to cross not realizing the cars have a green turn arrowsome drivers take this turn far too quicklysome drivers treat 39th between rodman and massachusetts as a speedwaysome drivers take this turn too quicklycars often speed through this intersection without stopping stop signs need to be more visibleduring pm rush hour there are many cars here that run the red andor block the box leading to dangerous situations in which pedestrians have a walk sign but cars are still trying to muscle through the crosswalkmotorists discharge their passengers into the busy cycle track or even sometimes park in the cycletrack they get aggressive and confrontational when cyclists try to get bydrivers especially delivery truck drivers park in or too close to the crosswalk this is dangerous because it hinders the ability of street users to see each othermotor vehicles fail to yield to pedestrians and use excessive speed as potomac avenue turns into oneway after 18th street signage on this portion of the intersection western crosswalk near e street are posted too high for motorists to noticem street buffered bike lane should be completed as originally intended providing protected lane as on other portions of m stmotorists often turn into parking structure without yielding to or seeing bike traffic in buffered bike lane poor visibility due to parked carsconsider removing one on street parking space at this garage entry pointthere needs to be a crosswalk here  there is a bus stop that lets off on the river park side but the closest crosswalks are at canal or 4th street a crosswalk is needed to allow people to get to the community center more easilymilitary road is missing a sidewalk for much of the distance across the parkvehicles particularly city busses speed through here constantly it is a sharp turn and many people jaywalk fromt he bustop across the street both a crosswalk and speed bumps are needed herecars turning right do not yield to bicyclists ive nearly been hit several timesthe sidewalk here is torn up from trees it is impossible to get by via wheelchair and very difficult to for two pedestrians to pass abreastpedestrians have a cross signal at the same time that cars have a green light to turn left from m st onto south capitol they often do not yield to pedestrians and are probably going too fast to see and yielddrivers often do not have enough room to get over to turn right onto 7th st from q and consequently often block the bike lane furthermore drivers do not signal here  i myself have crashed into a cars fender here because of thiswith virginia avenue closed here why not have the signals flashing yellow for fourth street there areno turns so no need to stop northsouth traffic thanksthis is a very confusingunsafe intersection for vehicles many vehicular crashes occur due to driver confusion poor sightlines and poor design this intersection needs a major redesign in coordination with mdcars continuing on u st east from florida ave often do not stop at the red light continuing through when the very short 15 second pedestrian light is on to cross u stthere needs to be a crosswalk here bikes cross this ramp to get to the sidewalk before crossing again after the bridge to get onto anacostia tral there needs to be a crosswalk and lights to alert driversthe light at the roundabout here doesnt recognize bikes they constantly have to run the red unless a car is also waiting to go straightthis section of rhode island ave is riddled with potholes so cyclists are often forced to go into the middle lane of traffic which is extremely dangerousstreet vendor often illegally parks in left turn lane during morning and evening rush hour periods  blocks both the turn lane and bottlenecks the bike lanecars and trucks often turn right onto 20th street from the the middle lane not the righthand turn lane often cutting off cyclists and forcing them to either slam on the brakes or swerve onto the sidewalk to avoid hitting themcars often drive way too fast down this section of new jersey ave in both directions i witnessed a cyclist get hit by a car here after the car was speeding to go through a red light and the signal already turned green for traffic going east on qpeds crossing ct ave  18th st nw is a disaster drivers run the red lights and block the crosswalks forcing pedestrians into the traffic lanes there also simply isnt enough time on the crosswalk countdown to cross 6 lanes of trafficwhy cant northbound traffic from maine onto 12th have a permanent green light theres no other traffic turning onto 12th here just give those turning left to continue on maine red and green arrows thanks for consideringthis should be signed as noright turn on redwith the new sidewalk closure around the o street market and accompanying advertising signage both pedestrians and drivers have difficulty seeing the northbound and westbound oncoming traffic at the corner of 9th  poften drivers pull up and through the bike box here both in the left and right hand lanethere isnt enough time for older people or seniors to cross herethere needs to be a crosswalk around the k street intersectiona lot of vehicles will stop and park along the e street bike laneas defined by dcmr 1899 crosswalks exist on all sides of an intersection and peds have right of way at all crosswalks but ddot has posted signs here allowing people to park in the unmarked crosswalks on both sides of this intersectionthis whole stretch of 11th from florida to s st is awful for bikers and cars cars dont want to share the sharrowed lane with bikers and pass very dangerously to get around them the road is also very torn updrivers routinely fail to stop and give right of way to pedestrians at this crosswalkthe last big storm blew down the convex safety mirror hung opposite this alley cars coming out of this alley now cannot see other cars bikes and peds please reinstall a new safety mirror opposite this alley on 13th between fairmont and girardtaxis and uber drivers block the crosswalk to drop off passengers herethe walk signal for the west crosswalk is only 4 seconds this is not enough time for the crowds at this point to get off the curb as peds are required to do by dc code 50220128 and dcmr 1823there needs to be a 4 way stop here traffic on girard has a stop but 11th doesnt drivers on girard either assume 11th street has stop signs or dangerously try to go through the intersection instead of waiting for a break in trafficbuses and other motor vehicles often begin left turn onto 7th street from eastbound penn ave when left turn signal is red posing hazard to those crossing on northern intersection of 7th  penn avewhy was this bike lane taken away now it goes from bike lane to sharrow to bike lane in less than a block cars dont give bikes room after crossing massachusetts and stay in the bike lane instead of transitioning properly from sharrow to bike lanedrivers routinely fail to stop and give right of way to pedestrians herethere are constantly cars parked in the bike lanes on 4th st sw between m st and i st they need to be ticketed and forced to move when biking through here their illegal behavior often forces me to cut into traffic to avoid hitting themmotorists often enter right turn lane without yielding to bike traffic in mixing zone more adequate signage should remind drivers to yield to bike traffic before entering the turn laneddots engineers have inappropriately taken walk time from pedestrians

pedestrians in the macomb crosswalk very dangerouscars routinely speed along this section of wisconsin which is heavily trafficked by pedestrianscars routinely speed on this section of wisconsin in front of the cathedral which is heavily trafficked by pedestriansthe bike lanes on 5th st nw north of here need to connect to bike lanes on 7th st nw to the southwest this is a small but important gap in the networkthe bike lane is consistently blocked by trucksdrivers drive aggressively and noone does anything about itthere is a large bump across the road due to an underground pipe but it is not marked someone even spraypainted to mark it but it faded it is great to slow people down but mean to hide the method of doing so paint this unintentional speed humpthere is literally no reason for this street to exist other than to store cars deadending it in the middle would prevent dangerous cut through trafficconstant standing around from pedestrians and cars loitering pedestrians are constantly in the street and are a hazard to both bikes and carscars including mpd vehicles wo emergency lights always run through this stop sign without stopping dangerous with families around perhaps a raised crosswalk andor speed hump on 6th btwn va ave and g st would help slowstop trafficcrossing wisconsin at woodley the crosswalk light is about 15 seconds long impossible to get across

wild west out thereas cars approach on e st se towards pa ave they are focused on the merge which is greater than 90 degrees to their left this then creates a blind spot to pedestrians as they cross from the right young trees in tree boxes also add to poor visas e st merges into pa ave there are two lane options for cars both of which merge into the same lane on pa ave only a single lane is needed for this one way street recommend closing off the right lane which has limited pedestrian visibilitythis 4way stop is often ignored by cars traveling along 11th st recommend making 4way stop more visible to car drivers perhaps with overhead hanging stop signs across the streetthis used to be possible to cross now light for pedestrians is way too short9th street going south is a one way

second or two of wait time between light changes florida turns green the same second that 6th turns red and it is just begging for a t bone car accidentthe city should buy this wendys and completely restructure the traffic pattern here it is the most inefficient and dangerous in the city for drivers bikers and pedestriansexiting gallaudets brentwood gate is dangerous because the construction vehicles are blocking the on coming traffic view they are also parked in the right turning lanegreat deal of speeding on this segment of eastern avenue with cars routinely exceeding posted 25mph speed

only a handful of tshirt and hot dog trucks cyclists going from the cycletrack to the mall are forced to split through gridlock traffic or ride on crowded sidewalks4th street is one way until it hits morse street heading south so oncoming traffic turns off florida into the warehouse district needs to be clearly noted that 4th going north is one way and 4th between morse and fl is 2 waythe inner circle of dupont is the lane for turning out of the circle and the outter is the lane for continuing around please explain and i mean that both as in justify this choice and if not changed put down

street for cars driving either north or south instead of normal red stop signs there are yellow signs many drivers drive straight through that intersectioncars fail to yield for pedestrianswe live close to this intersection at 12th and g se which presents a clear safety issue due to the intersection not having a four way stop this is especially dangerous to pedestrians as many drivers speed

10th stextreme pedestrian hazard i have nearly been hit while trying to reach the metro here at least 25 times drivers travel far in excess of speed limit and exhibit active hostility to pedestrianslight to cross nh is triggered by a sensor outside of rush hour bicycles are not large enough to trigger only can get a green if car comes up behindwestbound traffic only triggers a green for westbound eastbound remains redextremely high speeds on this stretch and no speed limit signs or enforcement have been victim of aggressive driving repeatedly for driving in the 2530 mph rangeincluding drivers passing to the right in bike lane someone is going to die heredrivers often run red light here because they dont want to wait i routinely see people stop look around and then drive through the light perhaps retiming would helpmay as well eliminate redgreen arrows for right turns from 20th to l as only about 20 of drivers obey them i have seen 2 pedestrians struck here since march and the drivers yelled at the pedestrians and drove awaycars traveling on 11th do not stop for pedestrians at this intersection its the only intersection along this stretch that lacks either a fourway stop or traffic lightconfusing sb traffic on 5th has flashing yellow pedestrians crossing 5th have no signal in crosswalk flashing yellow should mean yield but drivers speed through

dangerous for bikes to cross in high speed traffic drivers seem confusedhostile signageeducation neededthere is a crosswalk across georgia but it is extremely dangerous cars simply do not stop pedestrians need to wait until it is clear there needs more visibility to drivers that this is a crosswalkdangerous intersection this needs to be a four way stop signi live on georgia and constantly watch cars gunning it from the stop light on decatur to buchannon they reach ridiculous speeds sometimes and it is very dangerous there are kids playing in the neighborhoodgoing south on 7th right before crossing florida there are three lanes one clearly marked turns left the other two have no arrows but only the middle one goes through all three lanes need arrows because it it confusingintersection is a mess only one lane to turn left onto rhode island that is always backed up the other light same goes for the lane turning left into the shopping center from rhode island needs 2 left turning laneson this long downhill drivers will sometimes encounter a slowermoving car in front of them and will pass traffic on the right in the shoulder this is very dangerousare there two travel lanes here or just one the portion of eastern towards nh ave has two marked lanes but once you cross the hill and head towards kansas ave all road markings disappear but there was no merge what to docars run this stop sign with some regularity if no one is approaching from crittenden drivers feel that there is no need to stopin conjunction with the speeding issues on eastern this intersection is dangerous cars park right up to the end of the curb blocking all visibility numerous accidents have resultedwatched four policemen in two cars sit and do nothing about double parked cars in both travel lanes completely stop traffic on taylor street at 11am they were too busy chatting away to care about anything outside of their nonwork related conversatineed high visibility pedestrian crosswalkon weekday mornings there is excessive traffic backup on blagden because drivers traveling toward the city on beach dr have no stop sign at this intersection and drivers struggle

this intersection routinely yelled at by drivers to get out of the way so they can make the turn even though no right on red is clearly signedcrossing 5th is frighting drivers accelerate to reach green light immediately ahead and are looking only at light not at pedestrians needs pedestrian signage and speed enforcementcars traveling ns bound on 4th usually roll through this stop making left turn from elm on bicycle is very dangerous as cyclists are seemingly not visible and cars do not anticipate cross traffic at intersectionin morning rush many drivers make left turn to remain on ri ave from far right lane straightright only as middle lane is straightleft this creates danger for any driver or cyclist who has the misfortune to be following the lawits worrisome to cross here drivers apparently feel that since there are 4 lanes of travel the crosswalk doesnt count better enforcement neededdrivers who encounter a long line headed southbound in the am often feel that they can create a second travel lane in the shoulder and will just cruise past all other drivers who are waiting for their turni am of normal healthmobility and have trouble crossing the long way across the intersection from cvs to the eastern metro entrance within two light cycles needs curb extensions to shorten distance or barnes dance to facilitate crossingspeeding is huge issue on this stretch of eastern ave though the speed limit is 25 mph because it is entirely residential it is completely ignoredcars turning right from 13th st onto kansas usually at high speed as if it were not a right trun fail to stop for pedestrian crossing kansas at quebec place with the walk lightdrivers routinely use the bike lane on 7th bw fl ave and ri ave as a passing lane worst at r and ri ave where bike lane is dominated by drivers turning right but you dont know which ones will merge left having passed the congestion dangerouswhen biking nb on 4th st crossing il ave i am often nearly hit by cars traveling sb on il who blow the stop sign or roll through but do not look to see if the way is clearintersection is victim of bad angles cars required to stop going nb on il legitimately cannot see whether anyone is coming south on 4th may require removing 12 parking spaces to correctvery difficult to cross here high speed traffic uturns and distracted drivers looking only for parkingtraffic backs up in rushhours to the point that pedestrians are forced to dodge between cars which keep trying to move even thenroadway of 4th st bw shepherd and il needs resurfacing many potholes and loose gravel from attempted repairs makes biking hazardousroutine failure to stop for pedestrians for traffic coming south on 21st usually the westbound traffic on n is a little bettercyclists do not stop at the stop sign when coming south on 21stjust 14 seconds to cross 18th st on the north side of l stthe walk light to cross k st is very short  and cars coming northbound on 15th always run the red lightsthere is no crosswalk like on the southside of this intersection this is very dangerous because there is a green right arrow for eastbound o st traffic thus pedestrians crossing on the south side walk right into cars crossing with the lightcars do not often stop at the crosswalkcars often block the bike lanes especially at the stop lights in order to beat the red lightit gets a bit hairy on this road to bicycle because cars are speeding and there isnt much spacethe pedestrian signal here on the west side of 14th is very old and is barely visible pedestrians never know if they can crossthis ped signal should not be actuated but rather it should be automated this location is one block from the metro there are numerous bus stops nearby and a number of schoolscars turning onto 21st st from m st often pay little attention to pedestrians the traffic signal gives pedestrians a jump start but at rush hour all bets are off needs attention to increase pedestrian safetythis intersection has a long history of dangerous stop sign running it is near both an elementary school church and an area that has generally high pedestrian trafficthis part of m st is bananas the road goes from 3 lanes to 5 and then back to 3 meanwhile the bike lane disappears the result is pure chaos  car drivers do absolutely anything they want and bikers are very vulnerablecar drivers love to turn right onto k while traveling south bound on 15th even though theres a no right on red sign they also get very aggressive about it even though theyre doing something illegaltraffic backs up from the dupont red lights back through this light on both new hampshire and 20th yields a gridlocked intersection and pedestrians being forced to weave through cars to legally with the walk sign cross 20thcars and metrobuses routinely go through the red lights on both the inner and outer loops of dupont circle especially if they were backed up in traffic before the light changedif you are on quincy trying to cross kansas from east to west it is nearly impossible to see cars coming from the south until they are on top of youcars scream up and down kansas making it difficult to cross the street at quincydrivers have hard time navigating turn from northbound south dakota west onto riggs and end up running the left arrow light should paint turn lanes to assistthere is a crosswalk here and lots of kids crossing 5th to get to school but no stop sign and drivers routinely speed as they approach the light at 5thsheridan would be helpful to have a stop sign or a raised crosswalkcyclists often run red lights all along 11thdrivers going south do not often see cyclists going north very difficult to left turn for cycliststhe light timing here is ridiculous someone waiting to walk west to m st waits a long time to cross the circle and then has to immediately wait for drivers going east on the leg of mass ave crossing the entire circle can take 3 minutescar drivers going south around the circle make it to this point see open road and just let it rip highly dangerous since the terrible light timing encourages a lot of pedestrians to jaywalkthis threeway intersection is between results the gym and garfield park which is used by hundreds of kids tennis players volleyball payers dog owners etc cars heading south to the highway entrance regularly speed and do not yield to pedestriancars fly around the corner from georgia onto nh rarely using turn signals a lot of people cross here to get to metro and the only safe way to cross is against the light because at least you can see cars south on nh really dangerousduring both morning and afternoon commutethere needs to be a 4 way stop here i have lived on this corner for many years and cars cannot see pedestrians and therefore no one stops moreover cars coming down taylor cannot see the cars traveling along new hampshire avethis is a really hard intersection for pedestriansthe distance to cross is long and dangerous and it takes several minutes to cross the street during times of high traffic volume because there are so many different signalsdrivers heading northbound on 5th street can not see the intersection due to the hill south of quackenboss and enter the intersection at high speeds it would be safer to a stop sign on 5th to increase visibilityeast bound traffic undergoes a lane shift to the left as they cross the intersection but because of no directional lines in the intersection and a very wide right lane middle lane traffic veers into the right lanethe west bound light for drivers turning from constitution ave is far too long and causes unnecessary traffic pile ups this is especially true in pm rush hour when there are basically no cars going west bound herethere is zero enforcement of illegally parked cars on 19th street during afternoon rush hour particularly between penn and i streetthe timing for these two lights for north bound traffic is absurd once the southern e street light turns green the northern one turns red making it so no one can even make the light  so everyone then blocks the boxare vendor trucks exempt from traffic laws if not they should all be towed if they block the right lanes during rush hourthere needs to be more advanced warning of the right turn lane ending for south bound trafficdriver right turn from michigan onto north capital conflicts with pedestrian crossing due to delayed green for drivers with delay for walk sign so when both change they collide as pedestrians proceed into streetplease add a protected bike lane on penn ave between the white house and georgetownmy partner was hit by a taxicab here driver turned right on red and struck her please add protected bike lanes herecirculator bus drivers often pull away from the curb at the bus stop and through the stop sign without stopping again this often involves not yielding to pedestrians in the crosswalk as well very dangerousmotorists drive park and stop in the bike lane during periods of congestion on this stretch very very very dangerous for cyclists since they need to weave through and around stopped cars to avoidmotorists scream through this stretch which is terrifying if you are crossing the road in the crosswalktoo many drivers  cops and ambulances included  are driving the wrong way down a one way street many use it as a shortcut to get to the mcdonalds at the end of the street there needs to be better signage or more importantly more enforcementwe need a protected bike lanecommuters heading into the city using 5th st routinely run the stop sign here making the crossing unsafe for students and elderlythere is absolutely zero enforcement of illegally parked cars during rush hour these cars should be ticketed and towedthe timing for the north and south bound lights here was recently shortened to 15 seconds with only one lane and many pedestrians sometimes only one car can even go through which leads to many drivers running this lightdrivers routinely go 40 mph in this tunnelthere are constantly delivery trucks blocking traffic here during rush hourthis intersection has a yellow blinking light instead of a green and is poorly timed with the light that follows directly after it causing a great deal of confusion for drivers at the least this should be a standard lightthe pedestrian cross walk to cross h street is only 18 seconds this is also the time for the green light going south so cars push through pedestrians the light on h street is 84 secondsthe cars driving down h st speed because they have very long lights it is very dangerous for pedestrians who have to wait more than 80 seconds to cross h stmotorists harass and intimidate cyclists on this bridgecar drivers dont seem to understand that turning right on red means yielding to everyone else first they regularly push their way into and past the crosswalk despite the presence of pedestrians and cross car trafficcars traveling south on connecticut

existing signs to yield for pedestrians please implement the md avenue transportation plan it would greatly benefit md avenue and make the whole stretch much saferit is not clear whether pedestrians can cross or not i realized that there was a crosswalk halfway down the street towards 15th it would be great to move the crosswalk here or make it clear to pedestrians to move further downterribly

though there are signs saying it is the lawthere is a crosswalk but cars never stop for pedestrians because they dont see pedestrian signs single sign often obscured by trees so cars continue speeding down independence at high speeds combined with parking on street hard to look both waysjaywalking is most terrible around 8th it s bad all across h from 3rd to 14ththere is a sign that says notifying pedestrians that they must yield to pedestrians in the cross walk the cross walk is barely visible and the sign is not big enough so cars buses and school buses speed past while pedestrians are in the

longer it is never enough time to cross especially factoring in right turns from 3rd streetthis intersection isnt a 4 way stop but is frequently confused for one which causes dangerous

situationthis entire length of m street is an argument for a road diet the number of travel lanes available increases speeds additional and more visible pedestrians crossings plus the addition of a dedicated bicycle lane would boost safetyusabilityi st is great for biking but when you cant get across town without going down 2nd street which has no lane is very narrow and where cars give bikes no space to move youre basically telling people to chance it on k or h going westpeople dont pay attention to left hand turn signalsat the intersection of massachusetts and 7th streets ne there are two

east side sidewalk closed just south of albemarle on ct ave and the west side metro closed crossings at windom with a count down at 20 and i think a similar countdown at veazy for pedestrian is not enough timeit can be extremely hard to merge into the roadway because the side road enters on a hill and it can be hard to see oncoming cars and there is no chance to gain any speedcars esp evening commuters speed to make the lights at the end of the park frequently failing to yield to pedestrians in crosswalkssidewalk closed on east side ct closed and metro entrance close on west side puts additional pressure on this crossingcars run this red light with shocking frequencythere is no stop sign for southbound traffic on 14th street ne and cars rarely stop for pedestrians approaching or in the crosswalk a stop sign for all directions would be very helpfulthe lights at this intersection are very confusing with green arrows pointing in odd directions and a triangular intersection with multiple lights at various angles very difficult to determine who has green light or when legal to turnnot enough time for northbound drivers on 11th to turn right onto east capitol especially if there are pedestrians crossingin the morning there is no way to access bike share stations on 17th street when coming from lafayette square without either taking a long detour riding on a sidewalk or riding against trafficdangerous place to cross with two lanes of oncoming traffic it can be a long wait if drivers to not stop and both lanes do not always stop at the same timethis is worse than the other side of memorial circle because there are three lanes it is very scarydangerous to see fast moving cars coming off the circle and hoping all three lanes stop if a car has already stoppedcars on

onto constitution is permitted or not nearly impossible to see traffic coming north on 13th needs a space for cars to turn into to wait for light to change to continue east on constthere is no to cross oklahoma avenue between c st ne and benning rd ne right across 24th st there is a playground and cars sometimes go above the speed limit in this section because the road is straightoklahoma avenue ne has speed bumps between 25 st ne and benning rd ne bu t no speed bumps are present between 25th st ne and c st ne even though cars do speed along this section of oklahoma ave nethis ramps have poor visibility for both trail users and cars exiting and entering not many cars use the ramps in the first place why not close them due to low use or at the very least add stop signs before the crosswalks to make drivers stopeven though there is a double yellow line on oklahoma ave ne vehicles cross it to reach 21st st ne having to speed across two lanes only to find pedestrians crossing at 21st st ne in addition this intersection gets blocked during rush hourwith the new klingle trail there is no reason why we need all of these ramps closing all but two one to beach dr and one to klingle rd homes would reopen a large open space to peoplemotorists do not come to a full stop nor do they yield to pedestrians hereimpossible to cross c st ne at normal human walking speed during rush hour the light is just not long enough rush hour is also a busy time for pedestrian to walk to the nearby metro as a result people jaywalkreplacing 1 of 3 lanes with a cycle track would connect neighborhood to capital crescent trailjaywalking out of controlwhen the x2 unloads riders people jaywalk accoss the street regardless of the traffic lightunreal jaywalking hereexiting this intersection is dangerous due to bad anglepoor visibility and traffic light cycleparking on this narrow street is dangerous to all users removing this parking lane used by only 23 cars would create space for bike lanesduring rush hour it is impossible to get from the bike lane on north carolina ave ne to cross constitution and continue on north carolina ave nedeadend north dakota ave nw at 3rd st nw because few cars use this street and it creates an unsafe distance to crosslarge trucks vans and suvs parkstop very close to or upon the crosswalk here and reduce visibility so motorists who run the stop sign dont see crossing pedestriansspeed cameras make more sense than anywhere else in the district with no shoulder it would be unsafe to pull drivers over and as a result they speed without regard for othersmore people walk and bike on this road on the weekends than cars do on the weekdays could cars be permanently rerouted via ross dr nw to better connect our parkpolice cars drive on the bike and pedestrian trail instead of unlocking the gate as a result the trail is falling apart a few bollards at each end would end this illegal behaviordue to extremely low traffic this street should be permanently closed to cars and converted into a trailneeds bike lanes to better connect neighbors to rock creek park hillsunderused parking lanes encourage speeding and removing the parking lane on the walter reed side would have no impact on residentsthis street could add bike lanes to reduce unsafe lane widthsmany cars use madison st nw as a shortcut and turn at unsafe speeds adding speed bumps or add stop signs would help reduce thisdrivers especially those turning left onto jenifer fail to stop for peds in crosswalkdrivers coming over this bridge fail to comply with dcmr 22005 which requires drivers to drive at an appropriately reduced speedwhen approaching a hill crest this in turn contributes to probs at 8ththis part of porter is engineered like its a highway  notwithstanding that its the only street with a sidewalk that one can take to get from cleveland park over to mt pleasantadams morgancolumbia heightscars tend to speed down i street and up and down 8th street as they approach the highwayno one stops  too busy and going to fast on m st se to stop for pedestrians despite existing signage saying its dc lawtheres no safe way to cross ny ave by bike

bypassing congestion on constitution and east capitol speed and run stop signs on a st nenortheast corner of 8th and m se has some dumpsters that make it difficult for both cars turning north onto 7th st and pedestrians crossing 7th st to see one another  only a matter of time before someone gets hitthere is a stop sign but no crosswalk because of this drivers roll the stop sign if they stop at all the stop sign on 6th across from orleans has a crosswalk and cars actually stopcars driving west on i routinely run the red light several seconds after it turns redcommuter buses use east capitol street as an expressway during morning and evening commutes frequently driving 40 mph especially if the light at 15th and east cap is green very dangerous for pedestrians and elementary school childrencars rarely stop for peds crossing in the new crosswalk outside of metro or are parked in the crosswalk on the west side of the street if a bus stops for a ped cars speed around in the left

them there needs to be a ped signal at this crossingconstruction site does not have a detoured bike lane and trucks usually are blocking the pedestrian detour cyclists are forced to use a travel laneanyone westbound on cathedral avenue who wants to turn left or right onto 34th st is at risk because this is a hill and visibility is terrible cars parked on 34th st make it extremely difficult to see northbound trafficthere needs to be a no right on red sign on k st drivers tirning right on reddo not realize there are cyclists in the bike lane and only look left for traffic not looking right for cyclists current signage is not stopping this dangerous problemcars do not stop for pedestrians attempting use the cross walk to cross potomac ave occasionally cars illegally pass on the left side of a car stopped to allow a pedestrian to crossas soon as this section of potomac because 23 lanes one way going east cars speed pass this intersection to jockey for position to the front of other

difficult for pedestrians to cross pennsylvania which is why they tend to cross halfway and wait in the bike lanes to cross the rest of the waypoor visibility at this crosswalk means cars routinely dont yield to pedestrians because they are not visible this is the result of parked cars on the south side of grace st nwpedestrians need to press a button in order to cross and then only get 15

southbound conn av onto porter street many pedestrians pass through the gas station to get to the crossing to quebec street i have been hit by cars twicepeople often do not stop for the red light at the crosswalkconstant construction in the navy yard area crews are not allowing proper space for cars bikes and pedestrians sidewalks are blocked streets are narrowed streets are torn up and not fixed properly or in some instances not fixed at alltoo little time for seniors and people in generalnobody ever stops at the right turn red lightextend the cycle track all the way to constitution cyclists need to connect and there is not enough room on the sidewalk for both pedestrians and bicyclistsno crossing lane to rec center even though there are lots of kidsthis is a frequent route for cyclists who bike straight down p st to or from the walkway at the southwest waterfront park east there should be a stop sign at 4th and p to prevent cars coming down 4th and speeding around the corner onto p stthe valley trail crosses blagden road here there should be a cross walk marked on the road to improve safetyin the morning parent taking child to maret shortcut i had right of way on crosswalk driver did not stop almost running me over actually i was run of the crosswalkneeds a pedestrian crossing sign pedestrians cant see whether driver has a green light and right of waythe place where the pathway enters the street is dangerous the ramp area is not sufficiently wide to accommodate this heavily used transition by bicyclists and pedestrians on weekends and holidays when beach drive is closeddrivers fail to stop for pedestrians when turning off columbia onto euclid also construction on the church has blocked the whole sidewalk forcing pedestrians into the streetthese should be true modern roundaboutsthis should also be a true modern roundaboutpeople run the light at least once a dayno bike safetypedestrian in a wheel chair hit here because of poor visibilitylight is too short from crossing east side of porter from gas station to temple illegal left turns because sign is too small to seeconfusing lightsthe southwest portion of this intersection and continuing along oneida has no sidewalk making it dangerous to walkthis intersection sees a lot of speeding from drivers using 5th to commute into the city for pedestrians its quite difficult to cross 5th because there is stop sign turning this into a 4way stop would improve safety for pedestrians and driversduring the afternoon rush when cars are not allowed to turn right from k st on to rock creek pkwy and must take the ramp up to the intersection with 27th they routinely block the crosswalk where 29th intersects kspeed through this intersectiondrivers on sheridan often stop in the middle of the crosswalk here forcing pedestrians to walk into the road to crossthis intersection should be a 4way stop some cars try to treat it like a 4way stop i have seen cars rear ended and side swiped at this intersection it would be safer if 12th  g st se was a 4way stopcars rarely stop for pedestrians and it is a total guessing game and game of chance super dangerousalmost every time i get to this intersection to cross the circle from outside to go into the circle at the crosswalk there are cars who illegally cut into the lane from the inner lanes in the circle even though they are restricted to going to masscrosswalk neededcars coming southbound turning left into porter to go down the hill consistently run the red light endangering pedestriansthere is no curb cut for seniors those in wheelchairs or with strollers to cross van burenvisibility is very low at this intersection and because those traveling on madison to not have a stop sign it is quite dangerous this would be safer intersection with a 4way stopdrivers regularly block the crosswalk on the east and west sides of this intersectionthis intersection is dangerous and would benefit from a 4way stop sign to increase visibility and make sure that pedestrians including seniors and children can cross the intersection more easilycommuters using north dakota to cut over to blair often race through this intersection making it unsafe for pedestrians the crosswalk is faded and poorly marked adding a 4way stop and zebra crosswalk would improve safety for seniors and childrendrivers using 3rd st to commute intoout of the city to avoid blair fly through this intersection it would be safer for pedestrians with a zebra painted crosswalk and highvisibility signs in the middle of the streetraised crosswalkscars especially md drivers do not stop for pedestrians at the intersection there is a crosswalk but no stop signdrivers often fly through this intersection without stopping making it unsafe for everyonethere is a crosswalk on georgia here but drivers rarely stop for pedestrians its a very long stretch to cross especially if you cannot run and very dangerous in the middle of speeding trafficdrivers race through this section of kansas and the fact that there are two lanes with little traffic make it unsafe for anyone walking it would benefit from traffic calmingthe cars are going at least 50mph on east capitolthe lights are wrong here they allow pedestrians and cars to go at the same time someone is going to be killed at this cornordrivers routinely speed on this stretch of piney branchsome traffic calming would helpdrivers often ignore no outlet signs along k st  water st and speed down to the end of the road only to discover dead end they they turn around angry and speed back up the street endangering all

for pedestrians to crossno sidewalks the street is way too wide and commuters speed traffic calming bulbouts sidewalks and signaled intersections would make it safercars speed by and pedistrians coming from metro have to wait for a break in traffic this is unacceptable for an intersection across from a metro stationroad is in poor condition potholes meastbound drivers startthis light has a pedestrian beg button and will only provide a walk signal if pushed there is no reason that the ped walk signal should not be activated always and by default there are 6 schools within a 3 block radius of this intersectionthere is no sidewalk herethis intersection sees drivers racing through at unsafe speeds and would benefit from traffic calming and better visuals and markingsdrivers here on aspen regularly block the crosswalkdrivers routinely speed the road can be narrowed to reduce unsafe speedscars stop at the red light passed the line this forces bikes going from penn to 15 to make a right turn with diminished visibilitycars are speeding coming from bridge r e commend speed humplots of people cross here when they dont have a walk signal which makes it hard for cyclists to go through when there are no cars around it happens all day long the hill also makes it hard for cyclists to stopthe other issue at this intersection besides the jaywalking is the red light running ive

regularly run the light putting pedestrians at risk for cars going north many are speeding and go right through the red i have almost been hit about 6x in 15cars do not stop at this stop sign very

pedestrians stuck there and then red light runningthe light here at the exit to the commerce dept often does not change to green for vehicles exiting the garage the 14th st light will turn yellow and then immediately green again with the side walk also blocked turn leftnorth dangerous for bikedc has a lot of islands where pedestrians are stranded at sea because they cross one lane or st and then

motorists as well there are vehicles coming from five different directions and there are frequent accidents need a stop sign or lightthe light to make a left turn from piney branch onto blair is extremely short only allowing for one or two vehicles to make the turn before the light changes as a result many people run the light having a longer left turn light would be saferpeople using dahlia

sherman which is marked with sharrows there are few alternative routes northpeople often run this red light possibly because they are using 5th street as a shortcut to blair road please add some traffic calming to this section of 5th streetpossibly due to the walmart people cross in the middle of this stretch of road all the time which creates an unsafe environment for pedestrians bike riders

hit peds every morning the crossing guard suggested that we needed a no right on red signthere was a crosswalk at this intersection but it was removed why would the city remove a crosswalk at an

access point for pedestrians and runners and it is unsafesharp jog for westbound cars on ny is difficult to navigate even going less than speed limit so cars in left lane drift into the right lane theres plenty of room to straighten this out  narrow the weirdly wide median or remove 12 parking spotstaylor is a residential street with a lot of traffic through it from arkansas and piney branch

reasonbike lane drops out on this section of 14th causing cyclists to suddenly have to share the road with cars unexpectedlysignals and walk signs dont seem to be syncingthere should be a sidewalk here there are a lot of people who run and walk along this street a sidewalk will make it feel safer for people walking and runningthis corner has high bushes making it difficult for cars going north on 16th st that are turning right on to spring or ogden this is a dangerous street to cross for pedestrians for that reason a cross walk across 16th would also be useful herethere is far too much speeding at this location particularly given its proximity to a playground a speed camera or other enforcement would be very helpfulive lived at this corner for 2 years and nobody stops or pedestrians including mpd there needs to be a stop sign or traffic light at this intersection lots of auto accidentsspeeding by cars and wmata buses to catch the green light at 17th and independence couple that with the failure of all cars to yield to pedestrians in the crosswalk and residents are in hgh danger of getting run over when trying to cross the streetcar turning right on red light from park road would not yield to pedestrian walking across 18th with the walk signalcars turning left from florida onto west virginia often do not yield to pedestrians who have the right of way in the cross walk also cars turning right from florida onto w v do not look for pedestrians in the cross walk very dangerousthe button westbound for peds to activate the lights is broken not sure if this intersection really needs that feature but if it is there it should be functionalno cross walk here very dangerous pedestrian corner with poor pedestrian access to piney branch parkbike lane missing between florida and columbia rd causing unexpected mixing and an abrupt change of traffic patterncars on florida ave often run the red light at this intersection i have been in the cross walk with my 17 seconds to cross and have been nearly hit by cars going in either direction as they run the red lightthere are three lanes northbound at this intersection only leftmost lane is supposed to turn left onto pennsylvania but cars in middle lane often make the left turn too need better placement of signs so visible to drivers while waiting at light3rd st se from m st to virginia ave needs to be changed to one way northbound to improve safety and traffic flow and to reduce sideswipe damages to parked vehicles lanes should be configured and painted as on 4th street se  oneway southboundthe gap in the bike lane on 14th st nw from columbia rd to florida rd is a serious hazard to bikers many bikers take this road its what 16th st is for cars and buses  a major route into the city very dangerous needs urgent attentionintersection is not well marked stop signs are not particularly visible particularly northbound on 11th probably because of a big tree and the fact that the sign is far from the corner i think the stop sign for 11th street traffic is not neededbus drivers need better training to look for bikes before moving right for bus stopnorthbound bike lane would be helpful here allowing bikes to avoid the more dangerous stretch of 13th st to get btwn monroe and springtaxis often park illegally to drop off tourists who wish to visit the washington monument there is often short notice due to the curve in the roadthe curb cut to the virginia ave park was removed more than 2 years ago and needs to be replacedtiming of lights at pm rush hour make it tough for a cyclist to get from this intersection and around park cars are trying to make the lights too and this makes it dangerous for cyclists no bike lines around this parkneed contraflow bike lane so bikes exiting the gallatin st bike lane do not need to turn onto nh ave or ride up the sidewalk where many people hang out there is plenty of room for a lane and it will visually shrink the road to prevent speedingno bicycle infrastructure this block of l st and yet it goes from 2 lanes to 4 why not take the extra lane and make it for bikes 4 lanes is not neededintersection of connecticut nb20 str st needs to be redesigned for peds indirect multistage crossing to continue along ct av confusing signal patternnb drivers going too fast turning onto 20th stwould be great if there were some way to encourage the cemetery to create pedestrian connections heredrivers stopped more often when the traffic sign was up  would appreciate similar permanent signagethe circulator buses pile up here and do not move making it impossible for cyclists to use the right lane since the bike lane on the rest of e does not otherwise connect with the lane around columbus circlei regularly see cars not stop for pedestrians at this intersection encouraging people to cross unsafely it would be much safer and easier for all to cross as a 4way stopthe wait to cross florida can be over 2minutes and when it comes up it only gives you 7 seconds and cars seldom stop and frequently block crosswalk in heavy trafficdrivers rarely stop for pedestrians in reno road crosswalks despite many signscars traveling west on the southeast boulevard race across the intersection at 11th to beat the light cars get their first clear view of the light as top a small rise about 200 feet from it and then gun it scaryintersection

dangerousthe pedestrian signal for southbound westbound peds crossing mass ave is blocked by a sign move the sign back a couple of feetthere is a light here but peds will start to cross when there is a blinking red hand that leaves no time for cars to turn either right from 7th heading north or left from 7th heading south the drivers grow impatient and try to slip between pedsto go northsouth pedestrians have to cross l st to one island and then another island after ny ave and then finally get to the other side of l st they are given 17 seconds necessitating a wait at an island next to speeding cars hellcant cross ny ave from north sidewalk of h street without getting stuck on island inbetween inbound and outbound lanes second ped signal from island is very hard to see  easy to step into ny ave without realizing inbound traffic still movingsidewalks too narrow and in abysmal conditiondifficult to see around stone wall north of the street have almost collided with cyclistspedestrians coming around the wall on several occasionsdrivers coming south on 4th are used to people running the stop sign on s carolina so they often stop even though they have the right of way risking being rear ended it would be better if this were a four way stopcars turning left cut the turn too sharply and drive over the bike lanethere is no visibility as you come around the curve and cars coming from ga towards warder speed and move into the oncoming lane ive seen near headon collisions with both cars and bikes need speed bumps lane markers or conversion to onewaythe curb cut is in a different location from the crosswalk so anyone with a stroller or a wheelchair or a bike for that matter has to wheel into the street above the crosswalkthis intersection is atrocious  high speeds westbound on c street lead to tbone auto accidents and repeated failure to yield to crossing pedestrians this should be much better marked andor be a 4way stop or some other calming please thanksthis is the worst stretch of pennsylvania for cars speeding this is the section that they get to maximum speedmany cyclists act as though they have rightofway when crossing 23rd st in the crosswalks despite having stop signs need clarification of who has row here drivers or cyclistspedestriansthe light to cross 8th at e is only 15 seconds there is a lot of pedestrian traffic plus bus stops and it can take 23 cycles of the light to make it across the streetcan we have a bike contra flow lane on c st ne between 2nd and third it would allow bikes coming out of the capital grounds going west to safely access the bike lane on d st by turning left on third and then right on d ne avoiding mathis should be a twoway street from my office window i see about half a dozen cars a day go the wrong way down this street it is plenty wide for twoway trafficthe lights at virginia ave nwnew hampshire ave nw last far too long for the amount of traffic at this intersection at least during rush hour they could probably be 1015 seconds shorterthere is a large plant on the northeast corner of this intersection that makes it very difficult to see traffic moving west on i streetthere is some sort of electrical box on the northeast corner of this intersection that makes it hard to see cars if you want to cross at the crosswalkdrivers turning from r onto 15th nw should not be permitted to turn right on red at least from 7a7pm the only way for them to see whether its safe to turn is to pull up and block the cross walk which they all dono bike facilities on constitution the excuse is that cyclists can go on the sidewalk on the south side which for some reason is considered a multi use trail but is clearly just a sidewalk there is plenty of space here for bikes vision zeroextremely high speeds westbound on c street pose dangers to residentslots of red light running here makes this an extremely dangerous intersection for the many children who live on c street and walk through stanton park to get to the peabody and stuart hobson schools better marking the crosswalks would be a 1st stepthis entire intersection 7th and mass on through 8th is a real challenge westbound traffic on constitution often does not see or yield to pedestrians crossing south on 7th street and pedestrians cant see what the westbound light is doingcut through traffic with speeding and reckless driverscars drive very fast on connecticutthe cvs ramp to the second floor garage blocks a large part of the sidewalk forcing pedestrians very close to speeding wisc ave driversintersection needs to be redesigned only a few cars can cross michigan and taylor at 13th going south for cars traveling north if a car is turning left then drivers get stuck in intersection after light has turned red intersection needs redesignnow that hamilton is closed a lot more drivers are using galloway not enough time for pedestrians to cross and for drivers to turn either left or right from galloway to south dakotawith construction going on lot more drivers on galloway bus drivers rarely stop for pedestrians drivers hit or missdifficult to navigate bike with bus drivers and car drivers and get to interim mbt routechallenge to get to interim mbt route with bus drivers car drivers and pedestriansoften cars will try to treat this part of 4th st ne like it is 2 lanes and drive in the bike lane

nearly been hit several times in the am rush hourcars often do not stop for pedestrians in the crosswalk there used to be stop for pedestrian signs in the crosswalk but those got hit by cars and havent been replacedn cap st approaching fort drive turn only lane signage needs to start before coming around the corner to see the stop light people drive up to where the signs start and then have to get over and causes those who want to turn to have to waitdelivery trucks double park on both sides of the road during the morning commute forces cars to maneuver around them making it dangerous for cyclists and other carspolice cars often block the yield to pedestrians sign and as a result drivers rarely yield to pedestriansthere is a confusing white line which encourages cars to merge into bikes without looking adding a bike lane thru the intersection would make this much saferlots of speeding along reservoir near georgetown and rock creekintersection needs to be redesigned not enough time to cross both taylor and michiganneed sidewalk on east side of 1st place ne not clear why there hasnt been one all of these yearslong wait to cross south dakota at kennedyno safe way to get to

roadchallenge riding on riggs rd to get to interim mbt routedrivers on 6th st ne repeatedly use the bike lane to park this is hazardous to bikers who have to merge with cars often there will be an empty space on 6th near the double parked car but the driver is too lazy to parallel parkwe need a crosswalk here many people walk through the plaza cross 9th street and walk down the north side of d street but theres no crosswalk this means that people are constantly jaywalking and cars are not yielding to themmaking this street oneway eastbound would discourage unsafe behavior such as rolling through the stop signnot enough time to cross 6th st at indiana usually only 16 or 21 secondsintersection needs to be redesigned drivers run red light because not given enough time to get through both taylor and michigan to continue straight on 13thbus drivers and car drivers often speed down galloway dangerous for pedestrians because only one sidewalk which is narrow from construction and only one crosswalk which needs to be repaintedcars get a green arrow to turn on to c st from washington ave at the same time pedestrians get a cross signal cars do not yield to pedestrians in the crosswalk i have been nearly hit herethis is basically a bus parking lot and there is no enforcement of bus idlingeliminate this unnecessary uturn area give pedestrians more space to standa mustang owner has created his own private parking space here by placing traffic cones in an illegal parking zone it is stripped as such but there is no enforcementdrivers frequently fail to yield to pedestrians here a stop sign is solely needed because there is a school and children cross the street herethis crosswalk is unsafe because drivers do not have good visibility drivers are particularly bad at making the semilegal eastbound right turn this street should become oneway northboundnj ave is too wide and encourages speeding there is plenty of room to add buffered bike lanes on both side because parking is illegal along this stretchpedestrians on the south side of this street dont have a direct route to cross towards md the light cycle is also long which encourages people to simply walk acrossnowhere to cross to get to grocery store for miles need crosswalks on eastern avedifficult to see traffic if trying to turn right or left with cars parked on streetincredibly dangerous intersection layout is counterintuitive and the lights are poorly timed one of the worst places for carpedestrian interactionsthere are 56 lanes of traffic catered specifically to drivers that do not live in dc there has to

herecars fail to recognize the no left turn signs and hold up traffic as people incessantly blare their hornswith realignment of union station half of the circle there are frequent backups here and the 2 left turn lanes that merge down to effectively 1 lane just past the light do not actually help consider reducing to 1 left turn lanecars coming out of the circle frequently fail to stop for pedestrians at this crosswalk and are often speeding too sight lines are poor due to parking too close to crosswalk elimination of 12 parking spaces on either side of crosswalk would helpthere is no pedestrian light on the sidewalk on the southwest side of massachusetts cars see a green light if coming from the alleyway downhill and wiz through and the pedestrian has no way of knowinghave previously requested stop sign st 13th st ne and webster lots of speeding and ignoring the crosswalk visibilty issues make turning off webster dangerous as well thxthe security barriers need short

segments in center islandwhen cars are trying to turn left here other cars swerve around them on the right side via bike lane thats already illegal but what makes it even more dangerous is that its at

13th st intersection try to beat the line of traffic before turning right to continue on e capitolas both a biker and a car driver its difficult to see whether there are cars coming on 11th st due to the hill parked cars and the cars stopped at the maryland light makes turning left from f dangerousthis is one where people are going fast and turning during the very brief period when pedestrians get to cross and pedestrians tend to jaywalk here tooim not sure if parking is allowed here from 46pm but often a car or several cars are parked on 17th ave nw during that time this forces erratic behavior from drivers and encourages bicyclists to use the sidewalkwhen north capital backs up usually during the school year drivers drive the wrong way on this one way street to get to alley to get

realizes that they have just completely told cyclists to go die instead of trying to bike through scott circle a lawless land with absolutely no protection for cyclists by the way it also completely sucks to walk through herea man in a motorized wheelchair was driving westward in the eastbound road lane here because the sidewalks are so badduring peak hours bus commuters who alight here must wait

look at this 18th st and ct side by side with no bike facilities on either its like ddot telling bikes go diethis turn is simply not needed people can make lower speed turns at a right angle 20 feet

thomas circle is a death wish and bikes cant turn east anyway logan circle is a long trip up north make this contraflow for bikes de facto already isfor commuters driving into the city on potomac ave this is the only intersection without a light stop sign is easy to miss and the crosswalk isnt striped most cars roll through and few stop for foot traffic including my kids and me need stripesget rid of the beg button at this intersection why on earth should pedestrians have to press a button and potentially wait an extra light cycle stupid antipedestrian buttons must gothe wait for people walking is both extremely long to wait for green and extremely short to cross the street crossing also has very disorienting signs for peds especially those related to the actuated buttons ddot needs to

sides of pennsylvania you have to run to make it across in one lightnot enough time to cross e capitol also the whole time you have to fight against cars because they have same short lightbridge is

lot of speeding here in front of the elementary school there are speed bumps but they are so low on the sides you can just drive near the curb without really slowing downillegal u turns here are terribly hazardouscars run this no left turn arrow all the time its scary as a biker bc they are not looking for bikers who come at different speeds than pedestrians i often have to almost stop even when i have a walk sign to be sure that nobody is running itthe sidewalk here is so buckled that there are 45 inch gaps in the sidewalk it represents a huge trip hazard and would be impossible for handicap people to get down the street in addition there is no sidewalk on the north side of the streetthere is no crosswalk across suitland parkway i think that this might be entirely in md but it greatly affects dc peds going tofrom metro its so dangerous its absurdthe light at the bottom of the eastbound exit ramp creates rushour problems cars often back up onto the highway also need a biggerlonger left turn lane onto northbound 11th st and enforcement of turn lanesvisibility into and out of alleyway on east side here is very poor due to parking allowed too close to alley entrance please consider removing parking space to improve visibility i have had cars nearly run into me as i try to exit the alley herethis block is oneway and clearly marked as such but every day cars drive the wrong way by accident some try to back up some just speed up and hope nobody is coming dangerousthe crossing signal is only 25 seconds for a big intersection which often leaves cars no time to turn left after pedestrians clear the intersectionsome drivers do not understand that the road splits right onto i straight on potomac they get confused and run red lights stop in the intersection or swerve erratically pedestrians are completely invisible when that happensplease add speed humps to 1st drivers are 1015mph over the speed limit next to a schoolthe signal here prioritizes cars please turn the median lane on 7th into a turn only lane and lengthen pedestrian crossing time also the bike lane sucks which makes people on bikes choose the sidewalkprotected cycle track would vastly improve commute to downtown and would probably reduce congestioni drive and walk around this area and observe a lot of unsafe speeding would be helpful to have some traffic calming especially at the intersections connecting the parkrec center to the neighborhoodsthe sidewalk on the east side of connecticut is too narrow having a car lane right next to it is also dangerous for pedestrians who sometimes have to walk there due to congestion on the sidewalkthere area always a number of cars turning left quickly here and often disregard pedestrians trying to crossthere is no sidewalk on this side of the street so you have to compete with cars to get to new hampshire from oglethorpeneed some bike parking here near the coffee shopthere is absolutely no enforcement of the bus and bike lane so drivers ignore it this is especially dangerous when biking and cars jump into it quickly when traffic is stopped or slow in the main vehicle laneone of the new restaurants on the north side in this block has valet parking in the curb lane yet they frequently fail to actually keep their vehicles in the curb lane they often jut out into traffic a great deal making the travel lanes dangeroussometimes 99 second wait time to cross after nats games especially that is an invitation to jaywalkbike lane going eb in this block of f st ne is in very poor condition with severly cracked and potholed pavement switch between asphalt and concrete that is also in poor repair and lots of gravel and small debris please repairpeople on g st dont know cross traffic does not stop how about some signs before someone gets tbonedthe wide intersection weird angle of potomac ave and big trees make it hard to see people and cars signs are also difficult to seeespecially am rush hour cars do not stop at this sign trying to beat the short light at 11th stget rid of the beg button to cross eastwest why does it even exist the light cycle is timed so why do pedestrian have to ask to have a walk signal obviously they walk anyway if cars in their direction have a greenthis is a college campus yet there are no bike facilities 21st has two lanes that regularly carry cars at 35mph redesigning one lane for a separated bicycle facility would make a safe space for cars at 25mph pedestrians and bikesboth f and g streets have ample space for separated bicycle facilities there is otherwise no way to travel other than by carlight to cross g st is ridiculously short and many cars try to turn left from both directions causing other cars and cyclists to swerve around sometimes in front of other turning driverscars do not stop at this major intersection they roll through or speed through nearmisses happen everyday there are lots of mopedsscooters flying through too mindless of carssoupedup loud cars and motorcycles frequently gun it down k st like its a drag strip its unsafe and obnoxiousinstead of allowing on street parking near the corner why not make a leftturn lane since thats what most people are on i st to do in the mornings traffic can back up 2 blocks sometimesthis is the major pedestrian crossing in foggy bottom yet drivers still have priority divers speed through and block the intersection please road diet this to 3 lanes to keep drivers predictable and add medians so people can cross safely thanksthe corner of 14th and a st se is very dangerous moter vehicle traffic speeds down 14th st in hopes of making the green light not stopping or even caring about pedistrians 4 way stop sign should be installedprotected cycle track on connecticut to dupont

speed cameras people fly thru here on their way downtown unsafecars speed down new york ave despite lots of pedestrian trafficthe people turning right onto new york do not yield to pedestrians with a walk sign it is very dangerous and scarythis is a major intersection next to a park and bus stop that is dangerous to cross with a bike car or on foot it invites speeding and refusal to yield because theres a hill and its a long stretch without a signalcab drivers coming and going from the hotel make u turns and three point turns in this intersection all day long which is dangerous and disruptive to pedestrians cyclists and other driverssignage telling drivers that there is a crosswalk here is inadequate or missing making it difficult for pedestrians to cross the streetso many cars on their

intersection twice daily on my way from mount rainier to my work on u street nw it is a dangerous intersection and needs a light or something to help control traffic coming both ways on eastern thank youthe approaches to the sousa bridge need to be improved for bikes and pedestrians the sidewalks ramps and crosswalks are either in poor condition or nonexistent this is unsafe for bikespeds and

intersectionsbuild a pedestrian bridge over michigan avecars coming up from lincoln turn at high speed onto 2nd street and do not stop at cross walkthis street is too narrow to provide parking on both sides and two way traffic often times only one car can fit at a time so there is a constant traffic jam here its difficult and dangerousthere are numerous potholes on this street which makes driving hazardous and puts drivers as well as pedestrians potentially in harms way they also causes damage to carsremove the extra light at varnum and eastern wastebig hole in the road in east bound laneleft

trash debris high grass on sidewalk next to glenwood cemetery neeit is not safe to walk needs cleaning and 2ft grass needs to be cut did ask glenwood cemetery several times but still no responselights only change for cars and only give them about five seconds to cross cyclists then have to wait over two minutes for another lightsteps are not cleared after snow resulting in very slippery conditions and ice in wintercross at a designated light quit yer complainingcars do not stop at 4way stop and often speedif o street were kept as a nonthrough or changed to a oneway this would be a prime candidate for an ew separated bike path right now highschoolers and people in the neighborhood have no safe place to bikethis intersection would be safer for pedestrians and easier to use for drivers if the sidewalks were extended to limit drivers from briefly using the third lane to cut off other drivers please look to new york avenue west of 9th street to fixmajor construction areas at 4th  ri vehicles dont stop for pedestrians at the crosswalks speeding vehicles is another problem very dangerous furthermore the crosswalks need repainting need traffic camerathis would be an excellent place to divert throughtraffic from 6th avenue on to nj prohibiting cars from traveling southbound with a diverter would create a neighborhood street like 5th this would make room for a southbound separated bike lanethere should be a light at this very busy intersection i have witnessed a lot of almost accidents very unsafe for drivers and pedestrians especially with the bus stop so closelove the planters that are here please make more of them elsewhere to limit commuters from using local streets for through traffic thank youcyclists fly over the new pedestrian bridge three times i have almost been hit by them when turning left to go down the stairs toward the mbt they should have to walk their bikes across the bridgethere is no cross walk to get to the south side of the street to go by foot from the metro to the grocery store cars speed out of the parking lot making it very dangerous for pedestriansis always backed up when im in a rush during both rush hoursthere is not enough time to cross the streetalways backed up with traffic jams during rush hour in mornings and eveningsneed a marked bike path to cross sousa bridge in both directionscars also run lights red and yellow when in a rush as people are trying to wale across the streetspeople do not respect the signs and law enforcement are not doing anything to stop itvery dangerous area for everyonealways speeding up the streeta lot of people jay walk which causes a lot of accidents near the areaa lot of red light runners on buchananpeople jaywalk and they have lack of supervisionneed to put crosswalk so people know where to crossa pedestrian crosswalk signsometimes its hard to know when to crosscrosswalk not by traffic light hard to crosstoo many cars turn at this point which causes long waitingneed to trim trees and weeds on the freeway near sousa bridgethere is no sign directing north bound traffic entering this intersection no yield sign no stop sign no stop light a driver coming north on lincoln rd might well assume they have the right of way and get tboned by traffic on franklinmichiganmetro bus and several others have started using the right lane of southbound 1st street to turn left on michigan ave the street is not signed for this and has almost caused me to hit the illegal turners if i turn wide into the right lane rather ththe road is always in terrible conditions causing people to swerve into oncoming traffic in order to avoid potholesthis intersection is really dangerous for drivers at the stop sign who want to turn left toward lincoln mem very difficult to tell if cars coming the opposite way are staying on ohio drive or going toward whitehurst many close calls heretrees and weeds need trimmingtraffic to turn left builds up and the wait is long drivers will then try to turn left from the right lane and cause dangerous road rage incidents including one i observed where a gun was pulled also panhandlers block traffic  spit on vehiclescars turn right onto constitution from the two right lanes  the second lane often cant see pedestrians the middle lane is supposed to be a bus lane i thinkthere needs to be a stop light here so that persons turning onto franklin from lincoln arent having to fight everyone on franklin to get across now that the school is open on douglas it gets really busy at this intersectionthe pedestrian right of way is violated regularly especially by drivers traveling in either direction on 8th st and also by drivers coming east on c st particularly by drivers turning right from c st onto 8th stthis is a one lane road

pennsylvania ave and blow through crosswalks when pedestrians are meant to have the right away the addition of traffic signals with a bike icon may help them to comprehend the lawmore cars and trucks are making a left from connecticut avenue into california st ive seen quite a few near misses recently they are ignoring the no turn sign perhaps there should be a sign indicating the clover leaf from columbia to california32nd and albemarle gets very backed up and congested visibility is poor and parents rushing kids to nursery school makes for a dangerous combination east side of intersection should have stop sign and cross walkits hard to know what the logic of the crosswalk timing is here the signal says walk for only a small fraction of the time even though cars passing through are relatively rare mostly pedestrians seem to ignore iteach of these intersections should have a 4 way stop sign it is confusing when 80  have stop signs and a few do not very dangeroushard to see southbound traffic if youre heading north on bb and want to turn left on brandywinterribly dangerous for both peds and cyclists need separate lanestop sign running on 81 in eveningall along this section of connecticut cars suddenly turn onto streets and into driveways at high speeds and dont look to see if pedestrians are crossing there are many near misseswhile onstreet parking is allowed between the crosswalks at times the parking is vacant and motorists use the parking lane to bypass vehicles turning left onto 7th st se sometimes oblvious that cyclists are in the bike lanesthe street

wrong way into r street  going in the exit essentially especially cops going to the embassies on the corner of r  mass im a cyclistpedestrianmy concern is 4th street between i and south capitol street sw there is to much truck traffic that makes it dangerous to cross amidon school is right there at i and 4th street we need better signage to prevent the tucks from making it dangerousi live near this intersection and see drivers running this stop sign frequentlyduring rush hour 46 cars can be seen running red lights in one direction cars block crosswalkcrazy lane shift whoever designed this and allowed it to be built should be fired extremely dangerous especially in rain and other bad visibility days there will be bad accidents herethis intersection makes it easy for people driving cars to speed through the turn which creates a really scary environment for walkingthere is no pedestrian refuge in the middle of this crosswalk which cuts across 6 lanes of traffic oftentimes pedestriansjaywalkers get stuck in the middle with no protection from multidirectional traffic flowsbikers heading south on 1st st ne have to switch from biking with traffic in the righthand lane to a leftside protected bike lane at this intersection this creates a situation where bikers may have to cross against oncoming traffic at rush houri cross this intersection on the way to work and find that many times cars speed through the yellow or even just run the red light to cross georgia avenue i was almost hit by a car that sped through after my light to walk turned greencars speed east on q

theminstall sidewalksinstall sidewalk on west side of the street especially at the bus stop currently bus riders stand in grassthere should be an option to include blocking the bike lane as well but i will use this the brand new bike lane on 1st street is already a parking spot for delivery truckscars and motorbikes come racing down park pl some to catch the light others literally racing each other especially with motorbikes this should be one lane and have speed humps as there is now need for 2 lanes never enough trafficmain avenue needs attention because of the wharf development it is difficult to cross to go to the fish market and the traffic that goes passed it does not pay attention it needs pedestrian strips and sings to slow the cars downplease place a diverter here to limit traffic entering from florida ave if this block of r were a one way the cafe park and farmers market would have permanent room to expand r street could then have a dedicated bike lanecars drive too fastthis intersection is designed to let people driving cars speed out of the city that creates a really dangerous environment for people walking the design needs to be fixedtheres tons of room for a bike lane on independence but instead there is a lot of space for fast cars three lanes for cars seems like it encourages high speeds and makes it harder for pedestrians to cross or bicyclists to feel safehomeowner for 42 years on this block trucks over a certain weight are forbidden on this block because these beautiful houses are literally being shaken apart in recent years however this is not being enforced this is not local deliveriesgeorgetown cab dc license plate h97228 blocked l st bike lane when informed he was blocking bike lane he told biker he didnt care biker took photo of car taxi driver then exited car photographed biker and told biker f youthis is a very dangerous crossing for pedestrians also dangerous are cars turning right into the alley just south of corcoranit is hard to see pedestrians due to double parked trucks etcall of dupont circle is a pedestrians nightmare if pedestrians are consistently tempted to jaywalk that is an indication that the system isnt working rightthis is a general comment i dont bicycle but i support those who do why not devote a few streets exclusively to pedestrians and cyclists dcers walk or cycle while suburbanites speed past or over them and dont pay commuter taxes eitherboth streets at this intersection have a good number of red light runners in all directionscars traveling around the nw quadrant of dupont circle frequently ignore lane markings and signals especially the traffic turning right from the inner circle onto massachusettsthis is a general comment please see copenhagen in the downtown cars go over wide speed bumps that are really the sidewalkbicycle lanes so bicyclists and pedestrians dont have to break their stride but cars docars regularly uturn at this spot making it dangerous for bikes obeying the laws in the bike lanescars run the stop signs at this intersection traffic calming measures requested raised crosswalks would be ideal which would require motorist to stopcars use this street to avoid the lights on blair road nw and constantly speed down the street running the stop signs at the intersection would like do not enter signs to be posted for traffic control during

pedestrians to cross from south side of mass ave to the middle island is too short drivers coming from the outside lanes of circle also have a green which is misunderstood as signal to ok veering onto

ignore stop sign particularly when traveling south on 7th st nepoor visibility when turning from florida ave ne onto 7th st ne due to angle of the intersction which endangers pedestrians crossing 7th st ne at this locationscott circle is terrible for pedestrians the lights are not timed for people walking and as a result you can wait multiple times trying to walk around the circle this leads to jaywalkingtaxis and delivery trucks often double park in the cycle lane  even when there is an empty parking space available buses also dont pull fully into the curb lane when at the bus stop at ny and 9 and end up blocking the cycle lanei bike walk and drive this road it needs a bike lane from east capitol to mt vernon square this will protect bikers from cars and herd bikers into their space and away from driving lanes  safer for everyone connect to 4th st bike lanethis sidewalk island was ripped up for construction work months ago and was never rebuilt properly section of it are just

ticket for parking in their own neighborhoodmaking a contraflow bike lane on 10th between h and fl would be helpful keeping bikers off the pedestrian filled sidewalks and compliant with the oneway

block of p street in all directions many peds arent even looking and become hostile with drivers trying to navigate the congested block needs a midblock crosswalk or close the street to cars altogetheri park in the last driveway on g street just before 15th street ne and my driveway is often blocked by people parking on the street even when not blocked i have terrible visibility of cars coming from either direction which are often speedingcars taking a left on 3rd to go north dont look or stop once they lose the green arrow they dont stop for pedestrians and bicycliststhis intersection has more pedestrian traffic due to the new apartment building and giant grocery store cars using o street are often accelerating along o st after passing through stoplights a 4 way stop would make this area saferthe construction at the corner of m and 11th has forced m st to be nearly a single lane along this short stretch its extremely dangerous as a person on a bike passing by all the construction vehicles and cars not yieldingthis road used to be closed to cars and ever since it reopened the people mostly dc employees drive and park as though they are trying to kill the kids walking to school the whole road should be closed during school entryexit timescars are going way too fast for a street where lots of kids livethere is no reason for drivers to take a left on to n capitol please remove the turning lane and add a wide median to this entire intersection extend the sidewalks and finally make it a place that feels somewhat safe for people living hereseconding the one below extremely long and unsynchronized walking signals make this intersection a nightmare not to mention the high speeds cars travel down mass ave making it extremely dangeroustaxis drivers delivery trucks etc constantly block the l street cycle track at openings before left turns forcing people on bikes to weave into traffic to passthis is a road that connects a residential neighborhood

forcing bikers to the sidewalk or to salmon up the streetintersection is a disaster for both pedestrians and drivers the traffic turning left onto 19th have a left green arrow at the same time as the pedestrians have a walk signal result chaos always a lot of traffic here due to the doctors officesthe left turn red light might was well not exist given how often it is run by multiple cars turing from mass westbound to e streettwo issues here 1 terrible quality of road surface means dodging potholes when biking 2 cycling northbound there are parked cars ahead so you have to merge into traffic lane in very limited spaceno crosswalk provided for pedestrians on west side of 3rd st concrete barriers erected due to volume of vehicle traffic terrible pedestrian environmentive tried every direction going through this intersection not one has decent visibility add to that speeding commuters coming down wv is it possible to close this section of wv to vehicle traffic as a calming measurecars speed down 4th when the light is green not looking for peds its especially dangerous since theres a school with kids often crossing there this would be a great place for a raised crosswalk to slow trafficcars and metrobuses heading north run the red light frequently intersection shape means pedestrians are often already in the crosswalk on north side i count to five before entering crosswalk because i have seenhad too many near missesthis street could really use a bike lane it is a major connection point to the park and trails that many cyclists use to commute however it is a very stressful ride as you often wonder if you are going to get run over by a caras m street gets very busy with cars and the sidewalks are not only narrow but also crowded with people biking on m street can be very difficult for cyclistspeople on bikes are forced to be very close to parked cars that could swing their doors open as cars whiz by at high speeds to get through this dangerous merge and then drive in bike lane  blocking cycle trafficthe bicycle lane is blocked and not accessible the road is too rough to ride where it is openthe junction of marvin gaye trail  kenilworth park is undermined by the frightening crossing under csx295 overpass the sidewalk is too narrow there should be a railing bike lane separating from traffic  signs  lights are neededwestbound cars turning left from euclid on to 16th routinely fail to yield to pedestrians in the crosswalk after the left green arrow has ended there is a battle of wills between pedestrians and scofflaw drivers every time the light changesthe 18 sidewalk on the west side of 15th creates a hazard for people exiting the park as they go right into traffic before they can see anything this is exacerbated by the lack of a walk signal and enforcement of cars ignoring the stop line herethis is a confusing highspeed intersection next to a large charter school cars turning left from douglas on to 2nd a normal path for pickup dropoff are forced to twice cross two lanes of speeding lincoln traffic need 4way stop for lincolnchildren trying to cross 2nd street have to run to avoid the speeding cars flying through this very long crosswalkspeeding cars on 61st street do not stop for the critical crossing between the marvin gaye rec center and the gateway to the marvin gaye trailsharrows are placed too close to parked cars the safest place to ride in this section of f st is in the center of the lane markings should reflect that to ensure drivers know they need to change lanes to pass cyclists20 seconds to get across both bits are not nearly enough ill barely make it and im a healthy able moderately quick walkersignal timing is a very long cycle for e street nearly always far far longer than needed by actual vehicle traffic levels even at rush hours signal should be retimeddrivers routinely run red light across 3rd street to reach the highway onrampthere is no way for a cyclist to trigger a light signal change when riding southbound on 3rd st at some times of day light will only change when a vehicle is detected and bikes are too light to trigger it so light stays redpedestrian beg button is located in grass not accessible for cyclists or any pedestrians with mobility challenges also beg button is not needed  light should provide walk phase every single time dont make us begespecially a problem since the speed limit is 25mphcars drive very fast herewestbound drivers on virginia ave routinely speed here treating virginia ave as the start of the highway onrampnorth and southbound pedestrians have to wait forever to cross as signal strongly favors the virginia ave  onramp movement should be more balancedthere are a lot of cars atvs and motorcycles that speed through this street while children are outside playingnorthbound traffic on bladensburg get the right turn arrow before pedestrians crossing ny ave receive the walk signal cars continue turning at very high speeds after walk signal is on and cannot see pedestrians in crossing danger for pedsthe turn to get on this bridge is very tight and often times difficult to make as a bicyclist especially when there are pedestrians or other bicyclists presenteven without other pedestrians or bikers this sidewalk has very little room for error as it is very narrow it feels quite dangerous the railing cramps you on one side and the other side has a high curb which makes dismounting difficultwith cars constantly stopping on this road cars are forced to pull risky maneuvers which often have knock on effects for cyclists and make reading the traffic patterns on this street very difficulttaxi illegal uturnsome cyclist do not stop when the light is redroad lacks lane markings under the highway bridge when drivingbiking northbound impossible to know if there is one or two lanes here needs claritythe intersection where l meets k and west virginia is really dangerous for pedestrians please consider additional stop signs cars dont stop for us because they are racing for the lightthis intersection is completely torn up by construction and very difficult to navigate by foot and bike there are also cars coming from so many different directions it can be confusing to understand the traffic patternsnone of the pedestrians understand that their sidewalk is actually a bike lane even though it is very well marked maybe putting up some kind of cones would heighten awareness and make the area more biker friendlydrivers turn right from the secondtoright lane rather than pulling into the far right lane before turning large curb radius also allows for turn at relatively high speedsome cyclist do not yield to pedestrians already on the crosswalkcoming down the hill here it can often be very difficult to see cars coming up from the park on davenport st which makes the intersection a little more dangerousgiven the never ending construction this street it is a terror for everyone that has to use it constantly squeezed and funneled different directions as a cyclist pedestrian and car makes for a lot of confusion and precarious situationsmost drivers run this stop sign on harvard and many fail to

from the penn ave bike lane to constitution signs also say to use crosswalk for turnsthere is only one turn lane from m to 23rd drivers regularly turn left out of the center lane their visibility of pedestrians are blocked by drivers correctly using the turn lanethis crosswalk needs the large bright signage that tells drivers that they are legally required to stop for pedestrians in the crosswalk

eastbound laneim not sure what it is about this stoplight that pedestrians dont understand but i frequently see pedestrians walk through the intersection and almost get hit by cars making left turns with the green arrowthis could probably apply for all of connecticut avenue but it appears that the electronic signs indicating when rush hour motorists should use 3 lanes instead of 4 are obscured by

hairpin turn to drive down the alley towards 3rd street they often come through at high speeds which are unsafe for the residents who traverse the alley many of whom are young childrenpeople often jaywalk here in the morning because the exit isnt highly used and the wait can be about a minutecars frequently do not stop at this intersectionits at least 80 seconds wait to cross h st but it barely

replaceda round utility hole cover in the rock creek bikeway between p and m streets has severe raised metal edges which could flip a bicycle it should be replaced with a normal utility hole coverthis

disabilitiesmayflower hotel regular keeps valet cars across 23 lanes narrowing ct ave appreciably ive observed this repeatedly cause nearmisses for cyclists heading nb on ct avecrossing across 16th street on the north side of m st is very long because the curb steps back by the hotel on the nw cornertrucks at the courtyard marriott completely block the sidewalk when parked at the loading dock pedestrians have to walk into moving traffic to get around especially dangerous in am rush when curb lane is moving trafficthe traffic light on 4th st at n carolina ave needs to turn green sooner so traffic can clear the block between n car and pa ave before the light turns green on sb 4th st just needs to turn green about 3 seconds soonermissing crosswalks necessitate lengthy indirect multiple crossings thus everybody myself included jaywalks the crosswalks need to be addedim actually a resident and our vehicle has been hit in the rear and a sideview mirrow knocked off construction vehicles and containers cause a lot of weaving  with the speeding make it a very dangerous streetno left turn lane markings in the 3 lanes at the east intersection of i st and 11th means that cars turn left from both the far left and middle lanes cars turning left from the middle do not see bicyclists in the left lanesharp turn at bottom end of ped bridge puts you into the plaza at the metro a warningslowpeds ahead sign would be useful to warn bikes and reduce speed conflictsi live on k st and drivers go way to fast on this streetdrivers frequently blow through this crosswalk without stoppingor even realizing there is a crosswalk the corner is far too rounded making it very difficult for pedestrians to see cars coming up behind them extremely unsafethe corner at this intersection is far too rounded pedestrians cant see cars coming up behind them this corner desperately needs a curb bulbout or other traffic calming or just close the section of vermont ave between logan cir and o stthe crosswalk light here is very very short i see most people jaywalking as a result which is very dangerous on the circle the crosswalk light needs to be longer this is a high pedestrian traffic areadrivers frequently blow through this crosswalk its a very confusing intersection and many drivers dont realize theres a crosswalk or stoplight this intersection is in desperate need of a redesign its a pedestrian death waiting to happento cross nh here you have to walk across two sides of a triangle  both of which have a long wait the pedestrians cross at cross walks signs are futile why would a pedestrian spend 2 minutes waiting at two lights cross a streeti got hit on my bike by a car sedan that was pulling into the pmi garage because the parking spots that are between the bike lane and moving traffic were all full of suvs perhaps those spots shouldnt be usable during rush hours thanksno speed signs cars cut through k and speed up to 35 mph or higher have hit parked cars alreadywere residents of k and since the 11th street bridge and new entrance ramps opened about a year ago we see many speeding cars using k as a shortcut between 11th and barney circlecars will fly though here at high speed many are cutting through to franklinvista and are attempting to be faster than traffic down franklini am a resident on k stse and my car was hit while i was parked they never slowed down ps i was in the car there are also young children in the block and one day it is going to end badlydrivers routinely block this crosswalk leaving pedestrians stranded in the island in the middle of the roaddrivers routinely miss this red light seemingly confused by logan circles layout the circle has far too many intersections with roads resembling freeway exit ramps which encourages reckless drivinga pbl is desperately needed on the entire length of connecticut there is no real biking alternative for the many residents of this part of upper nw cars speed and act aggressive on the wide road and six rush hour lanes seems excessivethere have been two fatal hit and run pedestrian crashes this year in the 1300 block of southerncars turning left onto 14th going north and south often seem to only see pedestrians in the crosswalk after they are too closeregularly watch northbound drivers on 15th make a left on mass when the turn signal is red today it happened in front of 3rd district police car p302 and the cop did nothing driver then went on to nearly crash into someone at the next intersectionunsafe intersection for pedestrians too confusingdrivers routinely block crosswalk southbound at 16th and monroeeven with pavement markings cars turn right without looking  merging into the bike lanevery dangerous for bikers riding straight on r i drive a car too so i have sympathy for drivers who dont understand thisbut its still a problemcyclists often ride the wrong way in the bike lane creating an extremely dangerous situation for bikers using the lane correctlyoften people will walk up the driveway into the harris teeter parking garage instead of using the walkwayno bike facilities on this street big fat useless median 3 lanes in each direction but nothing for cyclists why does ddot hate cyclists why does ddot prioritize selfish car driving above all elsebefore and after basball games the lack of traffic lights at this and other intersections in the area along with the significant vehicular and pedestrian traffic result in dangerous and difficult situations for all modes of transportationthis neighborhood is used as a short cut often with ppl stopping at mcds on 16thpenn typically with md plates not dc they drive too fast for a neighborhood  are often distracted it is dangerous to cross the street w children or petsno bike lane narrow traffic lanes no turn pocket lots of pedestrians traffic too fast for conditions left turn across two oncoming lanes four lane configuration encourages speeding and is harder to cross safely road dietexplain to me why pedestrians lose half their sidewalk here so that this hotel can have a parking spot pedestrians have rights too but walking through here is a crowded mazexing from sw corner of f and capital cant do have to cross north and people jaywalk like crazy overall the area is awkward for pedestrians and volumes are pretty high given union sta in the areastreet too wide for amount of traffic please reduce to 2 lanes and 12 parking lanes and add bike lanesplease retrofit these barriers to allow cyclists to easily pass through just as they do at the white houseillegal use of handicapped parking spacewestbound drivers enter intersection on yellow and hit stopped traffic blocking crosswalkpedestrians dont realize there are two separate walk signals they just see the walk sign for the far side and walk right out into traffic clearer signage or synchronized lights would make this intersection saferwhen crossing from m street towards 14th st theres a tree with overgrown branches that obstruct the crossing signal and make it difficult to see if pedestrians can cross and the time left to crossdrivers routinely block crosswalk also west bound left turns conflict with ped movementcyclists often ride the wrong way in the bike lane creating a dangerous situation for bikers using the lane correctlydrivers going west on mass love to run this red light its a short green for them but thats no excuse drivers going around the circle also love to run reds through the pedestrian crossing here and often end up sitting here during congestionthis crosswalk here is ridiculously long just to cross a 1 lane road the curb ought to be extended on both sides as is car drivers like to charge up to the stop line at high speed and dodge pedestrians given the ample roomcrossing from rhode island to p or vice versa is made unnecessarily slow by a poorly coordinated walk signalcrosswalk missing on the south side of this intersection also there is no stop line for drivers once again utility work was done and no one from the city made sure that everything was returned to its original statepedestrian signal to cross 19th st on the north side of this intersection turns to solid red 20 seconds too early it turns to red the same time as the left arrow from penn ave to h st even though pedestrians still have 20 seconds to cross 19th stpedestrians on the nw corner of this intersection often stand in the road stand too close to the intersection dont look at traffic moving west from new york ave the road angle  speed means they are frequently at risk for getting hitmany pedestrians jwalk here to get to the bus stop on the west side of 16th street i have seen this cause one car accident and multiple near missesthe road is unnecessarily wide herevermont is unnecessarily wide at this intersectionplease retrofit barriers to allow bikes to pass through just as they do at the white house70 sec wait to cross is ridiculous for the low traffic on this street and everyone crosses against the light because of it please reduce this time to 1530 seconds maximumno way for wheelchair to access ally without going into streetdriver drove over the pedestrian island and turned south on 14th from westbound parkdrivers continue to attempt to turn from nebraska onto mass ave as if this is a true traffic circle creating a highly dangerous traffic situation this has been observed nearly every time i am driving through the circlethe bike lane runs on the right hand side but many cars are trying to split off right through the bike path many buses and trucks go right through here as well causing a true safety hazard for bicyclists traveling down ny avemany bicyclists heading west on r street ignore the red lightno crossing pedestrian signal and cross which then can cause near collisions with the bicycles heading south on 15th who still have a signal7 lanes of straight roads encourages speeding well beyond posted limits lanes are rarely used fullythis would be a prime candidate for a protected bike lane to connect pennsylvania avenuechinatown to the waterfrontthe stop signs on taylor need signs that indicate that the traffic on 7th does not have a stop sign twice in the past week ive been almost hit by a car going through taylor because the driver thought i was supposed to stopthe pedestrian signal to cross 19th st on the north side of this intersection turns solid red 20 seconds too soon it turns solid red when the left arrow for traffic from penn to h st turns green but there are still 20 seconds left to crosswhy is there a highway style right exit lane here all up and down pa car drivers turn from the main road the extra lane here encourages car drivers to take this turn at high speed also pedestrians forced to cross more roadcars do not stop for pedestriansthe road widens here why so that cars can take turns at high speeds this is an area with a lot of pedestrians and the crossing is unnecessarily widepolice cars and dhs police cars frequently park illegally between the crosswalk and last legal parking space greatly reducing visibility for cars turning onto m or new jersey curb extensions would be a great addition herea lot of speeding and during rush hour its not uncommon to see cars driving in the wrong lane who dont realize it becomes 4  2there are two traffic signals intended to stop wb fl ave traffic often the westernmost by wendys is green while the easternmost by apt is red drivers often dont see the first signal heads and blow through the red light bc the other is greentraffic signal cycle length too long reduce eastbound fl ave thruleft green time since there are zero leftturning vehicles this takes green time from nb traffic needed and wb fl ave traffic that are both held up for zero eb leftturning carsnbsb drivers on eckington dont see stop signs bc the road is so wide and wind up blowing through wout stopping consider road diet to shorten crossing distance and bring stop signs into drivers sightsits not clear that this is a oneway eb street lots of drivers go the wrong way there are one or two oneway signs but i think having pavement markings of a couple single arrows pointing east would make it much clearer to driversplease ban right turns on red here because drivers often pull way into the cycletrack before turning it is unsafe for cyclistssteep hill is inaccessible and traffic does not stop for pedestrians frequently run stop signsthe bike lanes here are useless cars park in them every morning thanks ddot for putting cyclists in dangerdrivers heading east on massachusetts frequently go over the line when going around the angle creating a huge risk to westbound drivers who have to merge right suddenly to avoid getting hit often causing them to clip the curbddot has painted all of these hashed lines around the circle but they provide no actual protection for pedestrians and are routinely violated by car drivers why not actually extend the curb or use bollards or planters with the painted linesexplain to me how this road should have four lanes of parking and no bike facilitieshamilton is part the interim route on the northern end of met branch trail from 3rd street to fort totten drive but the conditions on hamilton are terrible for bicycles the street desperately needs to be resurfacedcars dont stop for pedestrians or bicyclists a light has been suggested i would suggest also enforcement give warnings then tickets to remind motorists that they must yield to those in crosswalkshould be paint to show that there is a crosswalk at the top of bates and ft totten drive signs warning motorists on ft totten would help tooif you push the button you get a walk signal but it doesnt change the light any faster there are many bikes crossing

into crosswalklines are erased on the floor leading to confusion for some drivers drivers do not see the light and tend to run throughcars go too fast herethis block is exceptionally long encouraging jaywalkingdrivers rarely stop for pedestrians crossing 16th st at the uncontrolled xwalks very nervewracking because of the multiple moving lanespath is waaaaay too narrow13th turns is marked with two lanes at this intersection but the left lane needs to be marked for cars bearing left on 13th only and the right lane needs to be marked for cars bearing right on tenn onlyto cross the street on 24th st nw between the two sides of virginia ave it can get very dangerous as most cars are speeding and do not stop for pedestrians despite the sign saying pedestrians cross here the intersection is used by many residentspedestrian signal instruction peds to not walk on the sidewalk is highly unusual and unexpected resulting in cars exiting verizon center parking while peds are on sidewalkrequirement to press ped signal actuator beg button results in many peds never getting walk signal and then crossing on dont walk resulting in unsafe conditionslack of crosswalk across beach drive results in lots of jaywalking across beach around a curve with speeds at around 35 mph signage should instruct peds to use zoo overpass when open but a solution is needed for when zoo is closedplease trim the trees hanging over the bike lane  especially around the curveno crosswalk between the northwest corner of connecticut and cathedral and the northeast corner this forces pedestrians to go out of their way to

florida herethe stronghold alleys are animportant corridor for pedestrians bicyclists and children at play and its nearly everyday i see a driver slam on their brakes and a nearmiss after speeding through an alley oneways will not sufficebecause of the church homeless people gather on the sidewalk not only completely blocking it but also making it dirty and smellyns 6th street ped signal terminates over 5 seconds before ns traffic signal turns yellow triggering some peds to walk out into traffic while opposing traffic still has the greencars heading eastbound on upshur try to fly through the intersection to make the light and block the crosswalk across upshur herewe really really need separate protected bike lanes along 11th st here theres so much conflict between cars and people on bikes and it could be addressed with better separation and safetyno crosswalk between the southwest corner of connecticut and sedgwick and the eastern sidewalk of connecticut this forces pedestrians to cross sedgwick first delaying travelno walk signal when crossing sedgwick despite the traffic light for vehicular traffici have seen quite a few cars run red lights here there should be

usually and it gets very dangerousthe sidewalk south side of florida ave ne between 7th and m is extremely narrow plus there are barriers like poles stair rails for house porch please widen the sidewalk and perhaps add a bike lane on the side as hit two birds with one stoneneed to add vibrating crosswalk signal button for the deafblind and blind pedestrians on both sides of the street at

often run the red light way after its turned red either theres something wrong with the light placement or the drivers are tourists who arent used to lights on the side of the street rather than overhead look outthis intersection is very dangerous for peds bc southbound traffic on 13th has 2 lights right in a row the first green the second red you see a grn light and say ok i can go and then

hostile to pedestrians hey ddot the people on foot matter just as much as the people in cars and there are a lot of people on foot here in dupontthe light timing here is downright hostile to pedestrians there is approximately a 1 second window for pedestrians to start walking or else they wont be able to make it the whole way and have to stand on an awful little island and waitdrivers regularly role through this stop sign in an area where pedestrians regularly crossat dusk i was doored by a driver on his cell phone in a car2go even though i had bright led headlamp flashing this

unending doubleparkingcars do not stop at the stopsignssounthbound cars peel right into oncoming bike traffic and through the pedestrian crossing major hazardthe crosswalk on massachusetts and 4th is only 19 seconds and is just enough time for a able bodied person to cross the street safely for an elderly or handicapped person this is simply not enough time 30 seconds would seem more appropriatewhen heading westbound on dahlia across piney branch you cant see a thing you have to pull half way out into the street before you can tell if its actually clearcars regularly drive over the curb to park in fort mahan park it is very dangerous since they have to drive on the sidewalk to access the field in fort mahan parkthere is a crosswalk a little further north but with a grocery store and a high rise apartment building on the west side of the street many people coming from the south choose to cross here rather than walk further north and have to come back southa mirror is needed here so drivers are aware of a driver is approaching in the opposite direction there is only room for one vehicle going in one directioni live here and see cars speeding constantly there is an alley the cops could sit in to ticket people but they do notthis corridor is designed to promote high speeds and i feel in danger being on a bike i try to bike on the sidewalk but its disrespectful with the high pedestrian traffic surrounding the hospital so i bravely take to the streetsi have nearly been hit by a car once a month walking through our alleys which are often the place where children play and neighbors connect we need speedbumpsthere are two crosswalks on this section of 4th street and vehicles do not stop this is the most dangerous part of my commute westbound drivers from two lanes of traffic must merge into one lane where there is a high volume of bicyclists being instructed to follow the sharrow and take the lane but rarely domotorist routinely travel at high rates of speed when turning left from lincoln rdspeeding cut through traffic from north capitol is endangering property and lives on this street needs signage new speed bumps and enforcementdrivers often use bryant st as a cut through from lincoln to 4th street often speeding downup the hill on the 200 blockthe unit block of v street ne is a short cut from rhode island ave or lincoln ave to northbound n cap street cars speed down the street extremely fast which is very dangerouspeople blow through this constantly and it is directly across the street from a rec center where kids come and goi would sell my soul to the devil for a bike lane that spans columbia rd this is a major westbound bike commuter corridor and i see daily rage between roadusers being forced to share the roadillegal parking especially during football games  practice at the schoolthis is a very dangerous crosswalk for pedestrians  cars veer right to get on to lincoln from north capitol street at high speeds usually without signaling or looking for pedestriansneed to remove parking spaces in the lane leading up to new york ave causes major traffic delays on north cap when traffic backs upthis is the most dysfunctional intersection in the whole city get rid of the crazy wendys and build a functioning traffic patternthe crosswalk sign here is constantly being run over and dislodged causing problems this isnt a heavy pedestrian area and the nature of this turn make the crosswalk sign ill placed the sign should be removedthe location is not correct but cant move it closer union station the crosswalk to get to columbus circle is almost always blocked by queuing cars the drivers do not pay attention to pedestrians as they are looking at people directing trafficgood grief a sixeight lane road with no bicycle facilitieshey ddot design a road to look like a highway and guess what car drivers will do slow this road down make it multimodalthings ddot thinks are more important than providing a bike facility here two lanes of parking so bikers have to deal with cars trying to pass them with no space in the one remaining laneits a plagueduring rush hour cars sit in the intersection after their green light cycle terminates blocking both cars and bikes you should pursue using cameras at this intersection to enforce the lawcars are able to take this turn at too fast of a speed with heavy pedbike traffic in the evenings a bulbout should be placed on se corner to slow cars and make for a safer environmentconcur with the prev comment here the problem as i see it is that the zipcar van acts as a obstruction for cars to see oncoming traffic  vehicle or bike the van should be moved a few places away from the corner to permit better awarenessthis is one of the worst intersections in the city traffic comes from west virginia and off k street at crazy speeds and there are no stop signs until floridawest virginia and no one understands what to do at corner of 9th west virginia and lthis is a very dangerous intersection for pedestrians cars turn left and right from ri and capitol through the crosswalk typically never slowing down i have had several near misses while pushing a strollerthere is no automatic pedestrian walk signal in the direction of traffic flow pedestrians have to push a button for the walk signal this is a high pedestrian street bordering a university and an automatic walk signal would be very helpfulmotorists frequently speed through channing st 200  300 block using it as a cut through from lincoln st to 4th st nethere is part of the sidewalk that is gravel and dirt herejust to the east of the mcdonalds it gets very muddy and is slipperydirty for peds no one seems willing to take care of it this is a major artery for foot traffic going to the metroshould be a xwalk connecting the gompers park island to the smaller traffic island existing route creates unnecessary detour for peds with long signal delayscars routinely block the crosswalk during morning rush hour making it difficult and sometimes impossible to cross the street safelycars routinely block the crosswalk during morning rush with absolutely no care for the safety of peds with strollers canes wheelchairs etcgood grief all kinds of space available but this is designed like a highway for cars and with no facilities for bikesregardless of mode windows of cars are being broken along 15th between mass and ri eyes on the street here would be a good idea but at a minimum please clean up the glass in the bike lanetoo often peds are walking through the bike lane on 15th without recognition that bikes are coming creating a safety issue the nyc look campaign would be ideal for this corridorthis intersection used to be well marked and painted not anymore the sign in the road instructing cars to stop for traffic is no longer there and 311 has failed to replace it upon requestsput a bikeshare stand here dense housing no stand within blockscyclists consistently speed down r street coming from n capitol without stopping or slowing at the intersection one just about hit the front of my car after i made a full stop looked both ways and proceeded north on first streetthere is a light by the mcdonalds that allows traffic exiting the ri shopping center to pull onto ri ave however there is no corresponding signage for pedestrians and its unclear if peds have the right of way or need to stop for carscars pulling out of ri ave shopping center dont always acknowledge pedestrians which seem to have the right of way on the sidewalk i was almost hit here pushing a strollerthe car tried to turn right on red and didnt look for pedscars going sw on rhode island ave during the morning commute often block the intersection creating a back up on lincoln rd heading south because we cannot use the already short green lightthere is a rush hour parking restriction in this block across from an elementary school motorists are zooming to get out of town past students getting picked up from after care get rid of the rush hour parking restrictions and calm the trafficsomeone parked a trailer that has a speed limit sign and speed display in the right lane of rhode island ave during rush hour this becomes a travel lane the sign is blocking traffic and causing a bottlenecki jaywalk here consistently because there is no decent way to cross 14th or the circledrivers often do an illegal left turn off franklin onto girard and drive the wrong way on oneway girard so they can to left andcut south down the alley along the cemetary they drive fast through blind alley corners where many children are walkingmultiple times a day due to worship services cars mostly with md plates ignore parking signs and park right up to the corner of the street making it extremely dangerous to cross 18th street which only has a twoway stop signdrivers turning right onto 14th from t street often dont look to see if any bikes coming up on their right in the designated bike lane causing bikes to brake suddenly or swerve into trafficcommuters use 2nd st ne as a short cut en route to rhode island in the morning to bypass the traffic on lincoln blvd street safety could benefit from speed bumps as there are many small children on this block walking to school at shaedthis route is often used by drivers to avoid traffic backups on monroe street as a result and because nearby blocks have speed bumps the block gets too many speeding cars this block should have speed bumps as welldrivers on 4th street approaching michigan ave should be able to turn right on michigan ave on the green signal while yielding to pedestrians there is no reason to wait for the green arrow to turn right this causes unneccesary traffic backupscars are often illegally standing on the northbound side of the road on this block due to the apartments on that side it is very dangerous as it is a blind hill and traffic comes upon them quicklythe alley along cemetery is use illegally like a street  speeding cars in both directions and honking there is poor visibility on all turns and alley should be used as an alley onlyrhode island needs a bike lanethere should be a leftturn signal installed for drivers coming south down nw 6 street who want to make a left onto new york avenue to head west there is a lot of traffic here during rush hour and it is unsafe for drivers pedestrians and bikesthe one way sign has been damaged and is now turned in the wrong direction has been like this for 5 weeksthe hill on bryant is conducive to bad behavior from dirtbikesatvs speeding traffic calming measures would deter thisthis is a very dangerous intersection need to align 40th  fort and add a signalmajor conflicts here road is striped incorrectly not enough time to cross blocking the boxthe crosswalk here is not clearly marked as such drivers do not slow down or stop for people who need to cross the street hereno one clears snowice from the south side sidewalk which is in the shade it ices over and doesnt clear for a long timealways during football practicegames approx 530 pm always double parked carsi live on newton between 13th and 14th i am afraid that i will get hit crossing the street to get into my car we are applying to have speed bumps installedmetro recently upgraded a bus stop for the k2 here many people myself included cross the street to and from this bus stop every day unfortunately there is no crosswalk from the bus stop on the east side of the street to the west side of blair rdthere are not enough sidewalks on blair rd from riggs to milmarson this is the fastest walking route to the metro for many people but unnecessarily dangerous due to lack of sidewalksthere needs to be a left turn light here if you are heading south on blair and need to make a left onto riggs you often have to wait one or more red lights due to the volume of traffic heading north from rock creek churchit isnt clear how one is to transition from the barney circle sidewalkanacostia trail to traffic along barney circle or 18th some sort of transition area and signage is neededthe sidepath begins here and there should be some signagemarkings to make this transition easier there are also some light post issues here for those moving from the road to the sidepath a sign designating it a bike facility would help toothere is a lot of sand on the sidewalk on the north side not much maintenancethe crosswalk light heading south is 10 seconds  making it difficult to cross before westbound light changesdriving on 13th from otis towards newton is downhill this intersection has no stop sign but has a pedestrian walkway no cars stop and speed so badly that its impossible for the pedestrian to crossthe stop for pedestrian signs are not visible and are blocked by tree branchesthis is a slightly downhill street and there is no stop at the intersection of newton street and 13th speeding is atrociouscars always park on newton at the corner of 12th street there is a no parking sign but cars park and make it difficult to turn on to newton from 12th as there are oncoming cars from newton towards 12thyou often times have to get into oncoming traffic in order to see to be able to merge or cross trafficdrivers pull into the bike lane in the center to avoid double or tripleparked cars southbound drivers dont expect there to be a bike lane in the middle of the road and if they cut off a bike bicyclist has to swerve into oncoming trafficmany parkits have already come detached from road by drivers still doing illegal uturns and when a driver does an illegal uturn over a detached one it is pushed into the middle of the cycletrack and left as an obstructioncars going east and west on morse st ne often do not stop at this 4way stoptwo of the

street especially westbounddrivers wishing to turn right onto foxhall street nw often cut off cyclists who are trying to continue westbound on reservoir road nw poor lane markings and odd island placement make for a bottleneck for all road usersbike lane has not been restriped in years rendering it invisible taxis and drivers turning into omni shoreham and other properties often drive in nowinvisible bike lanedrivers going north or south on 4th st frequently run this stop sign i have had several near misses on foot and while driving because drivers speed through the signthe timing of the lights is too long at the entrance of elevation it seems to be timed more for residents there as opposed for drivers or pedestrians trying to crossthe crosswalks and walk signals need to be reconfigured for the visually impaired i had to escort a blind woman across the street because it was impossible to know when the signal was changing or the direction of the crosswalk since there are twodrivers like to hit injure and kill pedestrians who cross h st nw here httpmpdcdcgovreleasepedestriantrafficfatalityintersection1standhstreetsnwthis section of southbound rock creek church is far too wide drivers constantly speed and often try to pass even though it is only 1 lanethis section of new hampshire ave is very wide there is plenty of space to add a bike lane and bump outs for

traffic light timing along western avebicycles routinely run this stop sign when riding westbound on loughboro roadreversion to more driving lanes has made this stretch of wisconsin avenue treacherous for cyclists cars pass at close distance and at high speed please put center turn lane back in and enforce 25mph limit wspeed camshaving the safer passage here  through the zoo  close during hours when the zoo is also closed makes this a big safety risk as the tunnel sidewalk is too narrow to be safe for cyclists and pedestrians alikeon weekends both drivers and cyclists routinely run the stop signs at this intersection creating conflictwhen driving along the n capitol overpass it is really difficult to see pedestrians at the intersection due to the metal screens the screens block my view as a driver causing me to have to ease forward to see who may be comingas many people have stated there are multiple issues wrong with this intersection i will add that the timing of the lights is entirely too short turning onto wb florida avedrivers turning dont see bikes and often force me onto sidewalk or to make risky move into left lanevery narrow sidewalk being shared with pedestrians and bikers dangerous to pass either because it is so narrow as well as because of heavy traffic it is also not well lit in the late afternooneveningon the morning of 928 4 drivers came at me the wrong way on one way streets here 3 were drivers driving west on k  one north on 10th this seems to be frequently done by people that want to go to the parking garage on kno bike facilities here the sidewalk is narrow and has chain links on both sides not suitable for biking the road is design like a highway theres plenty of space please give cyclists somedrivers speed going westbound parked cars are usually absent at night and drivers use this space to unsafely pass needs curb bump outsone car driver will run this red light every single light cyclethe design of this circle for bicyclists is just atrocious redesign this so that cyclists have their own space around perimeter and cars must cross it at a 90 degree angle as is cars drive in bike lane all the timethe pedestrian signal head on the

stcars block the bicycle lane here regularlythe wait to cross at this intersection is so long that most people end up jay walking there are almost no cars going straight through so it makes no sense that it takes so long to get a full walk sign you get half then the other halftons of k8 students and parents are riding bikes to this school and there is very little signage in the surrounding blocks and the bike lane is unprotected3 handicap accessible parking spaces are needed on this blockwhy does the street widen right at the intersection of 17 and u it puts pedestrians at risk as they have to walk longer distances theres not much traffic here either this seems like a classic antipedestrian procar designwhy is this street so wideworst intersection long wait times  2 many out of state

not just on dc295 so the pedestrians are constantly dodging cars speeding into the city to workcars are using the slip ramps from dc295 to exit speed down the service road and reenter the dc295 to beat the traffic other cars ahead of them which does not allow residents to safely exit their neighborhood and get onto dc295this is a failed intersection delivered by fort meyer construction company that has never worked it has only created my confusion and frustration for neighbors and driversif you leave parkside the only way you can turn around to head north on dc295 is by using this dangerous

turn widerthink road marking or curb to show turn paththe crosswalks are poorly timed one ends while the other still has 1020 seconds left and drivers think they have the rightofway even while pedestrians still have the signal to crossdrivers do not stop for pedestrians in the only marked crosswalk at this intersection part of the issue may be that people are allowed to park right next to the crosswalk although really if a drivers vision is obscured they should slow downpedbike path on bridge is way too narrow and lacks real separation from traffic because high speed traffic is so loud cant hear bikes approaching from behindthis intersection could benefit from something as simple as painting and temporary planters as a type of chicane to slow traffic down there is a serious need to delineate clearly where cars should not block and where they are not supposed to bethis intersection at the very minimum needs a stop sign on sb 8th street watching for cars from the north is

double park here which completely blocks the flow of traffic all parking on ghr should be banned during rush hoursthe trolley tracks are insufficiently covered and the pavement is breaking down which

stop signs around it frequently cars are parked illegally around the crossing too making it very difficult to be seen when stepping into the cross walk  cars zoom right throughdrivers routinely park

lane a crosswalk and several bus stops close the section of wv ave between k st and 8th will allow for a safe intersection as cars will be directed by the traffic light at 8thon k between 8th and florida there is no need for a double lane in the evening rush hour in this residential area allow cars to park could encourage drivers to slow down to the proper speed limit as they would not consider it a highwaymost resident double park on this section of road as it is impossible to park close to our house h st customers and evening rush hour towing rob us of parking on fl and k we have to double park to unload grocery and kids then park 4 blocks awaythis bike path is a joke the hill is too steep please make the path going along the train tracks and connecting to the fort totten stationpark through 1st st this would encourage people to use their bikesthere is no sidewalk on s dakota between madison and nh so we walk on the street not really safe please add a sidewalk in fort circle park so we can access the nh bridge safelythe sidewalk needs to be wider to allow strollers and wheelchairs to use it on the bridge there is unused space on both sides of the lanes that could be used to do that also add a barrier between the sidewalk and the street to help us feel safersela pcs is right there kids are around yet cars are going fast and do not stop there is double parking etc the entire block needs to be reevaluated with this children population in mind please meet with the school staff and residentsa sidewalk is needed on this section of oneida st ne we are walking on the road yet there is plenty of space for 2 way traffic and a proper sidewalk there is currently no proper marking on the road so if feels like an alleyresidents are complaining that they can not find parking parents from sela complain that they are having a hard time dropping off their kids please work with residents and sela pcs staff to find a solution that can work and keep kids safecars from

major issue on riggsthere is no sidewalk on both sides of this section of the street this is not acceptable right next to a school walking in the street with a stroller or being in wheelchair is to dangerousthere is no protection for the bike rack located in the street cars often hit our bike wheels and we have to replace these as a result it is not used to its full extent add a concrete wall or something to protect the bikes and pedestriansthe sidewalk on both side of the street is in desperate need of fixing the lack of action so far may be due to it being next to low income housing and a retirement home but we all deserve safe accessthere is no sidewalk on blair road in some areas and those present are not wide enough this is the shortest and flattest access to some of the schools on kansas from the takoma station make it safe for our kidscontinue the bike trail along the metro tracks the hill up to hawaii is impossible to use as a cyclist the flatter the better so following the metro would be great i am sure something could be figured out for the transfer stationplease mark the bike lane so cyclists know where they are to ride on the sidewalk or on the street if on the street add some protection for the cyclisthorace and dickies seafood is a hot spot people double park park in the alley etc to get their seafood fix please find a solution and enforce parking here also cleaning the area would be appreciated the sidewalks are disgustingif you want us to use this bike lane redo the road mark it in green and put it between the sidewalk and the parked cars to keep us protected from the speeding traffic this bike lane needs to be longer then half a block to be usedif you want us to use this bike lane redo the road mark it in green and put it between the sidewalk and the parked cars to keep us protected from the speeding trafficvehicles turning onto riggs rd are not paying any attention to pedestrians riggs rd is considered a highway for marylanders and their is no consideration for the kids and parents going to the school located right therewe ride on the sidewalk as it is absolutely insane to ride on the street under the bridge please add a bike lane connecting the 1st st bike lane and the i st sectionthe sidewalk on the western side is impossible to use with a wheelchair or a stroller roots and bumps as well as it not being wide enough make it impossible to use north capitol really feels like a highway for marylanders to go fastthe rental place sunbelt uses the street as a private loading dock for their trucks it needs to change as it is a hazard to pedestrians biles and cars there is a school and a disabled adult center right herecars park in the blocked out areas on the street make it a parking spot or make it part of the sidewalks any unused space on the street will be used to stop and park unless you put a physical obstaclei ride on the sidewalks as the bike lane is not protected from cars i refuse to ride on a bike lane like that with kids on my bike put obstacles so cars do not end up in the bike lane and i will ride thereconstruction crews have monopolized parking and driving space on this residential block impeded

stop unless they are forced too by the school cross guard who is present only for a few hours that is unacceptable and is a recurring issue on riggs road not good with a school right therea pedestrian

ramp often do not stop for pedestrians who have a walk signal this crosswalk is not marked at allthere are too many lanes of traffic to cross at once this street feels terrifying especially as a visitor who is unfamiliar with dc drivers  as a visitor who recognizes that many of the drivers may also be visitors and not familiar with dcmotorists can only turn right on to n cap from patterson st north this is a feeder lane so they only look to their left for oncoming traffic and many do not take the stop sign very seriously meanwhile pedestrians are walking souththere is serious repeated running of this stop sign which is next to a school crossing and pedestrian walk way a camera is needed to prevent an accident or deathcrossing vermont is unsafe due to cars flying down sherman onto vermont with no visibility of pedestrians incredibly unsafe to get from v st to the new development at atlantic plumbinglack of 4way stop at this intersection is unique among all i st ne intersections between here and 2nd st and makes it tough for bicyclists and pedestrians as cars tend to speed through here trying to make the very short lights at florida or hcars tend to speed along 13th st ne

from benning road need a merging lane from river terrace to 295there are 2 merging lane and it is often difficult to see the cars that are entering 295 and the ones that are entering benning road it is dangerousive seen many residents in wheelchairs and walkers that can not cross safely in the amount of time allotted for pedestrian safety and while i like the brick crosswalk it does make it difficult for those in walkers to move smoothlyi cross here as a pedestrian every weekday i would estimate one out of every 30 cars stops when im waiting to cross today i got halfway across but cars going the other direction wouldnt stop so i was stranded in the middle of georgia avecar drivers rarely stop for pedestrians in designated cross walk and show little interest in slowing downalmost very time i try to cross at this corner which is many times a week someone runs the stop sign and isnt even looking for pedestrians this is right outside cfsa and its one thing for me to get hurt but there are a lot of children herecars often take a shortcut through this alley to circumvent traffic on m st and fly through it ive almost been hit on the sidewalk here a few times they then turn into the right lane and dangerously merge to get into the tunnel as mentioned herei have nearly been hit by speeding cars no less than 4 times while attempting to cross at this crosswalk cars routinely speed between the stop lights at colorado and decatur and rarely heed signs to stop for pedestrians it is not safe to cross heresidewalk is too narrow to bike across safely barrier between speeding traffic is less than a foot tall not safesidewalks needed between sousa bridge and minnesota avegiant sinkhole has been here since at least 2011 someday someone will run right into it currently covered by plywooddangerous passing by cars is common they will also often yell at me to get off the roadwaycars tend to take this right hand turn without coming to a full stop and expect to be able to take a right on red i broke 4 ribs because a car failed to give the right of way to the crosswalk turn is too shallow  cars go too fastsidewalk connection across the benning csx bridge is narrow and full of sharp bumps pedestrian signal takes forever to change and cars do fail to stop consistently curb ramps are narrow outdated and likely not up to complianceno way to cross benning beyond jaywalking through 8 lanes of traffic build pedestrian infrastructuregoing east from the benning bridge to the intersection the bridge dumps you in a weird place in the intersection with roads on both sides sketchy island needs improved pedestrian infrastucturepossible to do a barnes dance at this intersection there is no crosswalk to the sw corner over georgia so it takes a lot of effort to get to that corner bad for those businesses on ga south of missouri hard for wb peds from missourithere are lots of older congregants attending services at the churches across the street the cross light only lasts for 35 seconds not enough time for someone with mobility challengestraffic going ne on south dakota speeds through this corridor very dangerous with schools here and children presenti have to cross this street on foot with my children to get to turkey thicket there is a pedestrian crossing but traffic is too fast and heavy and often does not stop we need a traffic light here or some other enforcementthis intersection needs to better facilitate bicyclists turning from monroe onto 8th and vice versa this is a major route for cyclists accessing the mbt but navigating the traffic and turns here leads to dangerous scenarios for both cars and bikescars driving east on park often turn right and drive the wrong way on warder street there are small oneway signs but they are small and not very visible two large wrong way signs on either side of warder at this intersection would helpcyclists almost always ignore the red light with the picture of a bicycle on it despite the fact that its clear intended for cyclistspedestrians constantly jaywalk on this stretch of road even when there is a crosswalk right next to them they are incapable of staying in the crosswalkcars turning right onto g st from 9th street north often fail to come to a complete stop this is particularly bad during morning rush hourno sidewalks along this traffic island forcing pedestrians to take a circuitous route to walk down the west side of 9th streetno indication that the right lane of 395n becomes an exit only lane to 12th st drivers are frequently caught unaware and try to merge late often causing traffic delayscrossing ny ave at n cap is one of the more terrifying pedestrian experiences in dc turning vehicles do not yield to peds and make their own second turning lane that doubles the danger for people crossingcars consistently speed up and down street making it completely unsafe for pedestrianssidewalk needed along east side of arkansas ave between 16th and taylordouble parking is always an issue on this streetit is absurd that there is no direct way to cross to the street car and you have to run across three lanes of traffic on the h street speedway to get therecyclists refuse to pay attention to the stop sign or other pedestrians making this intersection even more dangerouswhite line needed on the exit to allow crossing of driveway during red light on traffic signalpoorly marked crosswalk we need crosswalk lights hereis this the worst 100 yards of double parking in the district quite possibly a real testament to the dc city government whose planning office happens to be on this blockthere is a school here right turns on red should not be allowed here think of the children mayorthis intersection has a confusing light for cars traveling west on alabama it goes from red to flashing yellow and cars often ignore both also cars driving north on 4th st through this intersection often dont stop for pedestrians at allcars traveling west on alabama turning right onto 8th st often dont see pedestrians walking on the crosswalk because of phone pole in the way and speedingschoolkids run across the street all the time and almost get hit even with the crossing guard thereterrible intersection for pedestrians the green light is short and the wait for it is longtheres no crosswalk on the east side of this intersectiontraffic is always heavy and many cars turn at this intersection there are also many bicyclists and there is a handicapped residential building nearby it is very difficult for pedestrians to cross the streetthe timed oneway signs on 17th street are not clear enough i see drivers going the wrong way on temporarily oneway 17th street every day and it is terrifyingcars regularly cut in front of the bike block as they wait to turn forcing bikes to swerve around them sometimes into oncoming traffic i collided with another bike today as i tried to avoid to cars doing just that very dangerous for cyclistsas mentioned previously cars routinely block the route of cyclists on 15th trying to cross k i saw 2 bikes collide this morning trying to avoid 2 cars that blocked passage visibility is poor both for cyclists and motorists at this intersectionon numerous occassions vehicles have nearly hit myself and my spouse they have yelled out the window screaming that they have right of way when in reality there are crosswalks and we are already utilizing them there should be a stop sign or lighta yield to pedestrians sign would help cars to slow down when approaching the traffic circlethere really should be a bike lane on this street many commuters bike down it to get to the vre station at lenfant drivers are very aggressive on this road and sometimes yell at cyclists for taking up their space a bike lane would make it saferpeople feel compelled to jaywalk here between the johns hopkins building instead of telling pedestrians not to there should be a crosswalk and a yield sign it is absurd to expect people to walk to either end of this long blockthe makeshift bike lane due to construction on the old washington post building is consistently filled with pedestrians especially during pm rush peds deserve their own safe sidewalk space here so that bikers and peds arent in conflictthank you for the new traffic light and crosswalk here but the light is angled so that eastbound traffic cannot see it until almost under neath it ive seen multiple cars running the light here apparently unawarecars going westbound downihll in pm rush hour are still taking both lanes esp at bottom nearat the light despite several signs indicating 2way traffic need more signs nearat the lightnew flashing lightsign facing eastbound traffic warning about new traffic sign is obscured by bamboo needs trimming back traffic light itself is also a problem see not therewestbound macarthur traffic turning left on arizona run light bc there is no dedicated leftturn light  they must fight oncoming traffic left turn lane backs up in pm rush hour need dedicated leftturn phase in light cyclecars regularly enter intersection after light has turned red and traffic is stopped thus blocking the box this seems to primarily impact bikers as their lane is blocked first and they are forced to weave around cars or weave into moving trafficthis block of columbia road has deep ruts and potholes that make it dangerous for cyclists and drivers could it be repavedthis block of columbia road needs to be repaved and crosswalks repainted where they are crumbling and cant be seenafter walking south across penn ave there is no longer a crosswalk to cross potomac where it meets penn on the se corner and cars often race through red lights from both penn ave and potomac ave regardless of pedestrian presenceseveral evenings per week this intersection is regularly blocked by eastbound cars filling the entire box they continue even after the light turns red and shorten the miniscule pedestrian crossing time furthercars turning left from i street nw onto 17th street are coming very close to hitting pedestrians crossing 17th street a left turn arrow would solve this problem and the related problem of cars blocking the box after the light changesis this a highway or a residential street jeez need some traffic calming herethere is a marked pedestrian crosswalk leading to the front of the takoma metro station that cars constantly ignore its signed but cars blast through at high speeds and its a very dangerous place they desperately need police to ticket theredrivers use chestnut street as a through way from silver spring and the park the speed along the street and rarely stop at the stop signs the neighborhood needs sidewalks at the very least to keep pedestrians safe and off the roadthe asphalt around this intersection is dangerous to all on the road particularly bikers some of it is temporary construction some of it is poorly done patchwork but it would be worthwhile from a safety perspective to repave this areacars fail to stop as required by signs when pedestrians are in walkwaycars will run this red light because they are focused on catching the green light at the following intersectionthe stop light here has a yield light not a green and there is no pedestrian light i have been crossing when the light unexpectedly changed and honked and yelled at by cars because i was in the intersectionthe road here is pockmarked with holes bumps rivets and all other manner of dangerous obstacles this affects everyone on the road but particularly cyclists please repave sooncars trying to turn right on red onto 395 from ny ave often fail to look for pedestrians crossing ny ave who have the right of way and signal to walk ive had numerous closecalls of almost getting hit in this wayid suggest removing the slip lane on westbound florida which allows cars to turn right onto connecticut this slip lane is not safe for pedestrians as cars can maintain high speeds while going through this intersectioni suggest removing the slip lane on this southbound section of connecticut avenue not only does this slip lane increase the distance a pedestrian needs to walk but also it allows a car to maintain high speeds going into this intersection13th st has many potholes and a speed bump at bottom the hill this giant unmarked speed bump in the road is the result from a sloppy asphalting job by ddot i am

intersection seems to really cause problems for ddot now they painted a white line across the intersection and drivers n bound on 4th dont think they can turn left which is troublesome because there are 2 left turn lanes on 4thdrivers continually block the bike boxes despite the green paintpoorly marked crosswalk and speeding drivers this is a bad thingdrivers routinely park in the outer

a st indicating cross traffic does not stopcars on a st do not realize traffic on 8th does not stop accidents here regularly kids are all over this block install signs on a st stating that cross traffic does not stop helpa st traffic does not realize 8th st does not have a stop sign accidents here regularly very dangerous intersection kids are all over this block install signs on a st noting cross traffic does not stopthe lane alignment changes significantly on florida avenue between 8th and 9th streets making it very easy to run headon into oncoming traffic this is a very scary section of roadcrossing new hampshire from both directions on s street is extremely difficult due to low visibilityhaving a multilane stop sign is just ridiculous at various intersections traveling south on 17th street these exist and it is so dangerousthere are no signs for drivers entering dupont circle drivers in the right lane often merge into the inner circle and drivers in the left lane merge into the outer circle which could cause an accidentthe bike lane traveling west on m st separates from the traffic lane at this location however the bike lane makes a very sharp turn that is difficult to navigate without veering into the traffic lane which is very hazardous during rush hourdangerous light pattern in circle pedestrians crossing from hospital side see red lights lanes of stopped traffic think they can cross cant see cars in far lanes still traveling around circle at high speed someone may get killedcars speed through this block of ga ave regularly our office is here and weve witnessed 3 accidents out front in the last 2 months just during working hours pulling onto georgia from hamilton is also dangerous in both directionsthis is a high volume truck intersection and the signal timing does not allow enough trucks to get through which backs up the intersectiondrivers run the red light here as pedestrians are trying to cross every daypeople blow through these lights in particular east bound perhaps better timing and a red light camera would helpevery morning there are cars driving west on mass ave that start to move across 15th street even though they are not able to fully clear the intersection bikes and pedestrians have to weave through cars once the walk signal turns oncrosswalks badly need to be repainted despite stop for pedestrian signs nobody stops and cars block the cross walks all the timecars heading east on ri ave frequently run the red light there is a red light camera that catches cars heading west but not eastwho gave the permit for this fucking dumpster  why is some private company allowed to turn this road into a one way right next to traffic light for over a year unacceptable to have this thing sitting here for over a yearcars never stop here and are going very fast ive almost been hit multiple times this intersection needs a stop signthese crosswalks are always blocked by traffic and are poorly marked lines are fadedbecause of red light camera intersection is only lit by one street light at night inter section needs to have better lightingcars speed up the hill and do not yield for pedestrianscars frequently blow through this stop sign without stopping fail to understand rightsofway at the 8way stop at this confusing intersection and fail to stop for pedestrians in the crosswalkcars frequently blow through this intersection without stopping and fail to stop for pedestrians in the crosswalk they also fail to understand rightsofway at the approaching 8way stop at this confusing and very dangerous intersectionbetween 2nd nw and n cap there are large patches of gravel in the bike lane very dangerous the surface area is in terrible condition as well but the immediate need is cleaning up the gravelthere are no sidewalks on this road and when politics  prose hosts a big name author this road is full of parked cars and pedestrians despite the safety hazards drivers speed here to bypass connecticut ave and nebraska ave trafficno sidewalks herethis road is treated like an interstate it is unpatrolled by law enforcement so speeders love this roadno sidewalk for much of northampton which is a connector street for many pedestrians to the park off of oregon aveintersection is confusing most drivers do not know which road military or broad branch the no left turn sign applies tothis road is very dark and can be dangerous for pedestriansa hidden stop sign around here is routinely runlong blind turn for those turning right onto military from nebraska often there are cars parked on nebraska in the lane that cars turn intomost people do not stop for pedestrians in the crosswalk on carroll st nw to get to the takoma metromuch of the sidewalks in this area are in poor repair or do not exist some are not wide enough to push a stroller on there are school children from st johns high school that have to unnecessarily cross the dangerous street in this areathere is no reason that this should be a 1 way street for noncommercial vehicles it just adds to increased congestion on other roads and therefore increased safety issues for pedestrians and cyclists on those roadsdrivers frequently create 2 lanes here when going east boundentrance onto the road is very difficult given the design of the onramp no merge areano sidewalk for much of this areain the mornings and afternoons young children catch the d series and w series and m series bus to school herethe intersection and lights are confusing drivers turning east onto military do not watch for pedestrians at the broad branch or military intersectionsthe intersection and lights are confusing drivers turning east onto military do not obey the red light in front of the broad branch roaddrivers turn right on red here frequently failing to stop for pedestrians crossing nebraskasometimes cars pass through a red light while pedestrians are crossing washington ave sw towards the american veterans disabled for life memorial or towards the rayburnbartholdi parkmy office overlooks this crosswalks many near misses of pedestrians someone will get badly hurt cars must be slowed or stopped multiple slammed breaks every hourneed to explain the new signal better to drivers some blow right through it when they arent supposed to and others stop at the light when they dont need to can create dangerous situations for all involveddue to the large turning radius on the southeast corner of the intersection the speed of right turning vehicles heading northbound and turning eastbound to arkansas avenue is very high and not safe for pedestrianssome carsbuses stop for pedestrians to cross but other cars go around stopped cars there is no yellow pedestrian crossing sign however those signs dont seem to work and stopping for pedestrian crossing isnt enforced in dcjfgas a pedestrian i witnessed a car running a stop sign nearly striking a cyclistjdfkleon several occasions i have nearly been hit by westbound cars on k street that blatantly run a red lighta white truck sped from the inner lane to the illinois ave exit as the driver passed near me he said ill fing run you over next timethis is an issue at this crosswalk as cars are also speeding and exiting the circle at high speedsmost days the bike lane is clogged hereoften buses that get held up at the stoplight and protrude into the new york ave intersectionoften cars are waiting to pick someone up and block the righthand lanealmost every dayi am a biker car driver and pedestrian not just one of the three drivers heading down macomb streets hill travel 3040 mph the school zone speed limit of 15mph makes speed tables or other traffic calming importantcars turning left from calvert downhill onto shoreham dr often fail to stop for pedestrians crossing shoreham dr probably a combination of it being a difficult left turn at rush hour and being unable to see pedestrians until partway through turndriver of wmata bus 7207 did not signal pull out and then did not signal as he cut across two lanes of traffic in traffic circle forcing other vehicles already in lane to take evasive action bus failure to signal in this area is commonthere needs to be a marked accessible crosswalk across this large intersection currently there is no safe way to cross to the trail on the other side of the street we should be able to access the sidewalk and trail from the neighborhooddelivery vehicles consistently block lanes during rush hour very dangerous and no one seems to want to fix the issuethere is a lack of an ada compliant cutout on the east side of 10th street when you are trying to cross from the small island at michigan to the main sidewalkpoor lane markings on aspen st nw under the metro overpass drivers travelling westbound will use the wrong side of the road eastbound to turn left onto blair causes nearmisses and traffic jams as drivers are blocked in the intersectionsouthbound on sandy spring stop sign here is new and drivers run it very often the sign is partially blocked by tree limb and possibly an electric pole this problem is in conjunction with the speeding that occurs through heredrivers speed through here probably trying to avoid traffic on blair traffic calming is needed here this would help the other issues at the intersection with aspen and at laurelnarrow road tight turn limited visibility many wrecks and nearmissesre bike lane on 6th st ne that connects across florida ave ne there is no pavement marker in the intersection to indicate that is a bike lane cars turning right or left onto florida dont realize bikes cross there and its a hazarddump trucks and other heavy rigs are increasingly using south dakota ave ne a residential street they speed and pollute and shake the sidewalks as they go bythe sidewalks on florida ave are not big enough to accommodate a wheelchair or stroller they are right next to heavy traffic with no buffercars are constantly speeding down this street which makes it unsafe for neighbors and especially children speed bump would be helpful in addition to more police monitoringdrivers uberlyft drivers often stopdouble park here reducing traffic to 1 lane and making it dangerous when cars swerve into the left lane to avoid the double parkersterrible views here with the blind hillterrible views here with bling hillin the rock creek east ii study gallatin and hamilton were identified as future eastwest connectors for bike shared roads can bicycle shared road symbols be expedited as this area gets heavy eastwest bicycle trafficthe sidewalk on the cemetery side of the road dissapears this is a very hectic intersection and a sidewalk would make this much saferat intersections on 3rd street there are crosswalks with two parallel lines and cars and bicyclists dont yield to pedestrians a higher visibility crosswalk with a ladder pattern would increase visibility and safetycar traffic does not stop for pedestrians at this intersection i watched a man on crutches make his way across from brookland yesterday and was worried for his life pair this with the speeding on ri ave and it made for a harrowing crossingthis intersection is dangerous because cars on franklin often stop in the middle of the intersection as they queue up for the signal to the east and traffic coming westbound on franklin are difficult to see if youre on 15th trying to cross nboundcar drivers speed constantly on michigan avegoing from 395 off ramp on s capitol no on follows street lines that lead to far left lanes drivers in left lane of off ramp drive straight and almost hit cars in right lane following lanesreckless driver was honking at bikers along 18th street from florida ave to new hampshire ave at 18th and s st intersection light turned green the aggressive driver sped up went around a car in front of it and cut it off in middle of intersectiondrivers turning right from virginia onto 23rd do not stop for pedestrians also there is only 1 turn lane but drivers always create a second and the second turn lane has terrible visibility of pedestrians in the crosswalkdrivers often fail to yield to pedestrians at crosswalk west across northbound 9th starrangement of intersection requires pedestrians to use two crosswalks to cross to the north side of g st when walking north up the east side of 9th st pedestrians often jaywalk to avoid the extra distancetiming of lights managing merge of southbound 12th st and eastbound maine avenue is highly problematic sensors should be used so cars dont wait for nonexistent traffic also causes issues with pedestrian signal timingintersection of 9th st south freeway off ramp g st and slip lane to lenfant promende is confusing and numerous close calls occur everyday signage is significantly lacking given the far from standard configurationsignificant volume of cars making left turns from 9th st southbound to westbound maine avenue failing to pay attention to or yield to pedestrians in cross walkcrosswalk lines are completely missing reported to 311 but no response there are no stop signs at this intersection and cars fly up and down 14th street someone is going to be killedcar drivers and bicyclists have a tough time navigating both the yearlong lane closure and rerouting on sb 1st street only to contend with double parking by cabuberlyft and dropoffs for hotels this is very hazardous for bicyclistsafter 300 pm taxis line to pickup customers at union station not allowing buses to make right turn which adds in blocking traffic and pedestrian crossing at the intersectioncars drive through this intersection very fast on 13th st and dont stop for pedestrians despite the cross walk the current signage on the road is knocked down at least once a week and is not effectiveevery morning at rush hour lots of cars in all directions running stop signs sometimes soft roll through sometimes egregiouslycars turning left from m northbound onto 33rd have a green left turn arrow but fail to stop for pedestrians that have a walk signal across 33rd once the left turn arrow disappearspedestrians must press a beg button to activate walk signal and walk signal timer is extremely shorttraffic signal for northbound traffic constantly stays green even when pedestrians have a walk signal and would be safer crossing harewood road if traffic was stopped see issue 44961car driving north on hawaii passed another moving car also driving north on hawaii by crossing doubleyellow linepedestrians crossing harewood road from south to north must look over their shoulder to see oncoming traffic making a right from rock creek church road to harewood road cars speed through the intersection and fail to allow pedestrians to crossdrivers traveling northsouth on 6th st tend to run this stop sign or only pause briefly here many of these drivers are coming from missouri avenue and appear to trying to shortcut around stoplights and bus routesthere is an apartment bldg on the east side of the rd and rideshare and delivery drivers tend to stop there though there is no parking or standing area there is no safe way for other vehicles to pass and poor visibilitythough this street is narrow drivers tend to speed down the center of the road and not accommodate drivers coming in the opposite direction it leads to a lot of nearmiss headon collisions and road rage incidentswhen westbound mo ave has the green the right lane gets blocked by vehicles turning north on ga drivers will swerve and switch lanes midintersection to avoid the blockageeastbound drivers routinely run the red light at this intersection and block the boxthe left turn lane from eastbound missouri onto northbound georgia is very short and almost always backs up blocking the through lane and the previous intersection consider eliminating the turn laneduring evening rush hour drivers on colorado avenue cannot turn right onto missouri avenue while properly observing yield laws if they then attempt to turn left onto georgia they can only do so by blocking three lanes of trafficsome cyclists choose military rd as an eastwest route across rock creek park as there arent many alternatives nearby they are hard to see and avoid bc traffic speeds so greatly and curves in road no bike trail exists adjacent to the roadit is very difficult for drivers traveling eastwest to see and yield to northsouth traffic because of parked cars in the curb lane a lot of drivers also get confused and think this is a fourway stopdrivers westbound on military rd in the left turnonly often decide that they want to continue traveling straight on military rd they will change lanes in the intersection without yielding this can happen one or more times per light cycledespite the concrete median on missouri avenue drivers on southbound rock creek church rd will turn left onto missouri they often endanger pedestrians in the crosswalk as they do soif i drive 40 in this 35 mph zone other drivers will tailgate me so closely that i can hardly see the hoods of their cars with merging traffic in the right lane and the curves in the road i am very uncomfortable with the average rate of speedpedestrians crossing western must cross three sections of road at between concrete barriers each section has its own walk light which is not synchronized with the others it takes more than one light cycle for peds to legally cross the roaddrivers westbound on military who are turning left onto western will change lanes midturn this is due to confusion about which lanes go where at the western and wisconsin intersection the lane changes cause near collisions and block crosswalksddot finally reinstalled crosswalk here but cars now park on either side of the crosswalk blocking visibility ive been asking for some do not park signs to be installed here for the last 6 monthsprivate cars taxis and buses all speed down this stretchdrivers enterexit driveway without looking for pedestrians first very dangerous considering that there are 3 schools in the immediate vicinitythe crosswalk is fadedmissing here pedestrian visibility is very poor here especially given the nearby 3 schools and heavy vehicular traffic a crossing guard would be an added pluscars often block the crosswalk across riggs making it difficult for pedestrians to safely cross the street there are many bustops on this street as well as 3 schools in the vicinityit is very difficult to cross the street at the marked crosswalks cars speed up and down south dakota which compounds the issuethis is a school zone yet cars speed by during the school daycars coming off of 395 do not yield to pedestrians many drivers if they do stop continue to inch their cars toward pedestrians still in the crosswalk this has been an issue for at least 8 years nowcars turning onto galloway from sd ave do not yield to pedestrians in the crosswalkthere is nothing in between pedestrians and cars except for a 23 inch thick cinderblock that is about 3 feet tall there is also only enough room for 1 pedestrian to walk finally there is zero lightingif you want to cross legally you have to wait more than a minute to cross 1st st  even though there are no cars there is a long left hand turn light and no one ever turns left24 seconds to cross 4 lanes of traffic watch a school group try its darwinianright turn on red and green its like they are aiming for pedestriansbuses illegally blocking bike lane and letting off passengers every single dayso no stop sign cars just run red lights here every single day i see 5 cars each cycle during the morning and usually another 12 each cycle in the evening not just 1 second late but like 34 seconds late surprised more people not hit herewatched from my car as a group of kids tried to cross the street in time they didnt make it thankfully cars stopped for them kids were small too shame on dc traffic planners clearly hate children crossing

because the southern section of 2nd street is closed all cars at this intersection are turning into the crosswalkscars on 11th street turning right on e capitol can only turn with a green arrow but the green arrow turns on when the pedestrian signal is on to cross e capitol  this means that cars on 11th street are turning directly into pedestrian trafficpotholes and narrowing roadcity restriped the road incorrectly and the cars now merge into the bike lane reported this to 311 and mayors office many times over last 4 monthsparked cars create a blind spot for their left hand turns hereright hand turn is very sharp and tree blocks the view of crosswalk making it difficult for drivers to see pedestrians frequently people cut the crossing short too because the crosswalk is took longthe guy who lives here drives around in a big caravan and acts like he owns the place total jerkonce again this morning a driver ran a red light turning onto 6th street from pennsylvania ave my kids and i were riding our bikes on the way to their preschool and narrowly avoided being hit by an inattentive driver we need a red light camerathe red light runnning at this intersection is unbelievable and there are several preschools in the area not to mention playgrounds at the park so lots of small kids around red light camera needed for 11th st se crossing nc avethe stop sign is not visible from the new hampshire ave going north about 13 of the cars run the stop sign also the cross walks are very long given the angle of the intersection they should be reduced by using poles or bump outsneed 4 way stop or liteneed 4 way stopneed for arrows on lights for turning onto 13th st from arkansas in both direction very confusing intersectionmaybe 1  20 cars do not even slow down for this stop sign at least 14 slow somewhat but still roll through so quick itd be hard to classify them as rolling stops which probably nearly all other cars dojackson between 15th  16th ne has a very steep hill and it is impossible to see oncoming traffic cars parked on both sides of the road make this basically a single lane drivers routinely speed over this hill need speedbumpsbetween 10th and puerto rico the sidewalk narrows to 2 ft or less and has been uprooted by trees keep the trees please but the sidewalks need widening and levelingwidening of taylor to 4 lanes and design of this bridge encourages speeding even with an ebike going 25 mph i have been run off the road it is unsafethe short bike lane on hawaii is routinely blocked by turning traffic and large trucks at the intersectionthis is a very dangerous intersection way too many accidents car traveling both ways on kansas ave often traveling at high rate of speed slight hill doesnt help with visibility something has to be done about this intersection either a 4waycars heading north on 15th try to take sharp left onto new hampshire when they have a green straight arrow this is not legal their lane has a straight white arrow painted in making the turn they cut off cyclists in bike lane with green signaldrivers refuse to stop at the stop sign ddot refuses to improve the signage and design mpd refuses to enforce the traffic laws sooner or later someone will be killedmany speeders go through intersection'"

       "'cars for valet at the capital grille constantly block the crosswalk illegal uturns here there is no walk sign on this intersection so i never feel safe crossing i dont know if the light is about to turn green for motorists on vermont avenue constant issue mpd never enforces despite repeated requests some cyclists often run this red light developer blocking entire sidewalk and portion of road cars drive very fast on this stretch danger to pedestrians especially seniors and children as a cyclist who lives in this area the block between irving and park on 14th st nw is particularly terrible when it comes to double parking and parking in the bike lanes cars park in the bike lanes here northbound signal at ny ave remains green long after nbound signal at h st turns red traffic backs up into north crosswalk even blocks box entirely signals desperately need retiming on 1st st the 2way protected bike lane runs along the east side of the street at l westbound drivers turn right on red if they stop at all despite oncoming 2way bicycle traffic i have come within 2 feet of a tboning driver twice postmounted signs on sw corner facing eastbound traffic almost completely block approaching motorists view of pedestrians entering crosswalk extremely dangerous after 7pm when right on red becomes legal red light running and speeding is a major problem on massachusetts ave at this intersection during rush hour taxi drivers routinely exceed the allotted space for the taxi stand at the hotel and park in the crosswalk northbound drivers turning right onto k ne frequently turn without yielding to 2way bicycle traffic on the 1st st protected bike lane signs suggest yielding to bicycles but signal separation is needed tour busses consistently block eastbound bike lane drivers turning south onto 9th from f st from either direction routinely fail to yield to pedestrians in crosswalk redlightrunning also extremely common intersection needs a dedicated leftturn arrow for wbound cars turning south onto 9th st when events occur at the verizon center loadins are scheduled during rush hour multiple vehicles park in the rush hour zone on the east side of the street on the morning of 62915 they were parked in 2 of the 3 lanes ongoing construction here has the south sidewalk completely blocked off and closed forcing peds to cross the street there is a crosswalk here but cars are often going very fast and its not easy to cross illegal uturns theres a crosswalk here across 15th street tofrom the park but its at the top of the steep hill and theres poor signage so cars never stop for peds walking into crosswalk needs blinking lights etc for safety ive almost been hit here government shuttle busses stop park in this block during rush hour no parking hours in the am the other 3 streets do not have this restriction please get this illegal shuttle bus stop shut down all day every day at every light cycle between 14 lanes of car traffic block this box furthermore drivers make left turn on red against the light and without stopping even bullying pedestrians out of the way shuttle bus keeps stopping here even during the rush hour no parking times multiple instances of shuttle bus stopped in the right most lane from 4630 pm daily near impossible car often treat this as a limited access highway i have encountered a government shuttle bus double parking in the bike lane to discharge passengers on multiple occasions at this location on 14th between irving park bike lanes are constantly blocked by double parked vehicles adding more chaos to an already complex road environemnt westsouthbound drivers accelerate aggressively off the light at eastern cars on 20th often fly through with little slowing construction site has closed the sidewalk without proper signage rerouting they often impinge on the bike lane as well and park construction vehicles in the south bound lane without traffic rerouting or traffic direction cars will pass bikers in an extremely dangerous fashion drivers frequently use the right turn only lane to proceed straight on eastbound i st and drive through the bike lane when making a right from west virginia onto l st its difficult to see if any cars are coming up or down 9th st and folks often speed its also difficult for cars to negotiate right of way here because west virginia traffic doesnt stop drivers double park in the southbound bike lane waiting to pick up students from howard every day from roughly 34pm forcing bicyclists to quickly merge into very fast downhill traffic cars delivery trucks metro shuttles taxis park in this bike lane all day every day lanes are very wide on the bridge drivers speed to the next light or carry high speed into brookland or edgewood drivers frequently make left turns onto penn from the right lane proceeding across marked bike lanes to proceed west on penn and interfering with drivers making the left from the left lane frequent uturns across the bike lane in the middle of 11th made by valets from the two restaurants on the corners of 11th penn drivers in bike lanes all the time never enforced crossing florida ave at 2nd street is a multiminute experience constant speeding close passing intersection dangerous for peds at rush hour at night rush hour drivers illegally turn left off nb 13th to drive under circle also frequent red light running low visibility of peds lpi works as slight deterrent but traffic cam would be better wmata vehicles regularly use the sidewalk to park vehicles including wmata buses regularly go 3540 down this residential street people regularly standpark in the bike lanes light timing and light visibility means that drivers often continue through crosswalk even when peds have the green light i am concerned about the ability of pedestrians to cross north capitol to get to the bus stop on the southbound side between pierce and l the crosswalk is long and faded and drivers there move quickly and aggressively the only time i dont see drivers blocking the box here during pm rush is when ddot officers are present this intersection needs a serious redesign literally no one obeys the school zone limit here there are two schools here this area could use a continuation of the 11th street bike lane as it gets very congested until the bike lane returns further down the road not enough time to cross 12 seconds i believe when walking from south side of ri ave to p st cars frequently run red light from circle to ri ave makes for dangerous situation as peds then have remaining time to cross 4 lanes and island cars double park for safeway and dc government offices in the bikelane all the time while 2 lanes on 1st street turning into florida ave have a sign showing 2 lanes are designated for east vs west cars turn from outer most right lane onto 2 lanes marked for east instead of onto west which leads to side collisions w cars cars constantly take lefts over the l st cycletrack here and in many other places along the cycletrack holding up traffic and potentially killing cyclists drivers blocking bus stop bring back the crosswalk it was recently removed for no good reason and this has become extremely dangerous 90 of vehicles break the speed limit here to a dangerous degree the crosswalks at 19th and a st se were removed and replaced by an inconvenient midblock crosswalk further up 19th this intersection most certainly needs a crosswalk for pedestrians parking lot gate left open every night blocking entire sidewalk this should be a fourway stop traveling east on d street i cant see traffic coming from the south because of parked cars and have to inch slowly and dangerously into the intersection and just hope i dont get tboned there is a poorly marked crosswalk here and cars rarely stop for pedestrians for some reason cars drive really fast in this stretch probably because its 4 lanes we need at the least better crosswalk signage and a stop for pedestrians sign cars traveling along florida ave routinely refuse to stop for pedestrians here often erratically honking and antagonizing peds cars dont seem to realize this is a 2 way stop and cross traffic doesnt stop very difficult to see around parked cars on east side of 2nd st ne when turning left onto 2nd from any perpendicular street pedestrians regularly cross here at douglas where there is no crosswalk i am not suggesting citing pedestrians but instead would like to see some fix that would allow people to cross safely to the apartment buildings on the east side of brentwood this road need a bike lane if you are on a bike cars will pass within inches of you cars always speeding never giving room when passing the bikelanes on 4th st between madison and jefferson are too narrow and put cyclists in the dooring zone the south side door zone bike lane on east capitol at 2nd is perpetually blocked by a cone placed there by us capitol police explicitly to force cyclists into the general travel lane also door zone bike lane there is no safe connection between the welltraveled bike route on the capital crescent trail and foggy bottomrest of dc va ave has nine lanes for cars and nothing for the hundreds of cyclists that have to brave speeding lanechanging motorists sidewalk deteriorated i mean really bad drivers frequently enter bike box and crosswalk at this intersection during am rush drivers blocking bike lane drivers hardly ever stop often go straight from heading east to turning into the mcdonalds parking lot in one fluid swerve lots of people make a token rolling stops if even that on their way down 4th street presumably heading towards the freeway onramp the eastbound bike lane is always blocked by idling vehicles during rush hour totally useless ive had cars have a difficult time seeing me on my bike at this particular intersection drivers frequently make right on red without regard for traffic heading north on 6th st nw many many many of people mostly kids from the high school jaywalk across the street to get from either the bus bay metro or to the school one child was hit here in this location last year a midblock crossing with hawk signal is needed here cars frequently parked here during am rush hour restictions cyclists dont stay in the bike lane here due to permanent blockage by us capitol police on independence ave for similar security purposes theyve built a parking cove but not here on east capitol pedestrians frequently cross 6th without regard for the pedestrian signals and remain in the intersection against the right of way frequent jaywalking at this intersection in the am this whole intersection in such a bizarre mess crossing here is very difficult ive seen many drivers honk and be aggresive towards cyclists on this part of piney branch while ive been running failure to stop for pedestrians at crosswalk cars frequently run the red light turning left from n capitol preventing pedestrians from crossing allison st uncontrolled parking area in the median of pennsylvania ave between 3rd constitution requires drivers to use the bike lanes to approach the parking area friends have been struck here drs so much speeding so little enforcement cars always speed along florida from beyond the ne side to the nw side creating a difficult situation for cyclists there is absolutely no enforcement of the bus bike only lane on 9th st i was hit by a car here when i was in the cycle track there is absolutely no enforcement of the bus bike only lane on 7th st ive seen a lot of accidents on this corner between cyclists and cars and have almost been hit myself as a pedestrian at night people driving cars constantly block the box here at rush hour forcing pedestrians and bikes into traffic to cross when its their turn ive been almost run over at this crosswalk more than once by cars not stopping and or not paying attention government shuttle bus double parks here multiple times throughout the day drivers often run the red lights on rhode island ave at florida 14th st nw colorado ave kennedy st has major bus stops and pedestrian traffic with many pedestrians crossing at 14th and colorado they are technically not jaywalking even tho there isnt a marked crosswalk at that intersection cars dont stop i would like to be able to take my class of 15 students to the harry thomas rec center but there is only enough time for about half of them to cross an extra 510 sec on the crosswalk light would mean a lot drivers often do not stop for pedestrians in crosswalk here confusing markers on ny ave about which lanes allow drivers 2 turn right unclear if only cars in outer most right lane can turn fork or if cars from 2 right lanes can turn right fork motorists driving northwest on mass ave through scott circle often run the red light at rhode island ave for 23 seconds after the lights change cyclist going wrong way on bike path on 6th st at intersection of north carolina and 6th st i was crossing west on north carolina with the light when the cyclist nearly ran me and another pedestrian down the position of the ramp height of the guard rail makes it difficutl for rt turning vehicles to see a cyclist coming off the ped path to cross the street inadequate lighting makes if difficult to see peds crossing suitland pkwy difficult to see cars moving up down v street ne when trying to exit alley onto street particularly concern bc cars often traveling on v st ne speeding using residential st in eckington 4 short cuts bw n capny ave corridors rh island ave ne drivers often run thru stop signs speed in eckington particularly on 3rd t st ne using residential streets 2 bypass congestion in n capny ave 2 access rh is ave ne bikers frequently fail 2 pause stop sign while using bike lanes in eck off mpt dangerous in area w increasing car pedestrian traffic second light here should be coordinated with the one on 7th eliminate the beg button pedestrians must press a button to get a walk signal why as a result many pedestrians walk without a walk signal drivers try to plow through because they think pedestrians dont have right of way lots of cars going very fast down 2nd st drivers often block this intersection due to waiting on drivers to turn left from florida onto rhode island eastbound left turns should be prohibited at this intersection since they can turn left onto ri at 3rd st pedestrians often jaywalk to the middle of the street and stand directly in the middle of the bike lane while the bikes have a green light drivers are often running the red light on n capitol at florida and end up block the intersection as well lane shift here makes no sense makes it hard to avoid the bus stop and bike lane drivers are always blocking the crosswalks at this circle cars repeatedly fail to yield to pedestrians people are afraid to cross the street here even though theres a cross walk with a timed walk signal traffic coming eastbound on calvert gets a red light before traffic facing westbound and waiting to turn left onto 39th but theres no indication of this for the westbound traffic there should be a green left turn arrow here cars especially those heading northbound in the morning often run the light many times entering the intersection after the light is already red cars often blow through the stop sign when turning left from r st onto 3rd cars very aggressively cross the bike lane to turn right onto rhode island many times without signaling or looking for cyclists cars heading westbound routinely block the side walk forcing pedestrians to walk into oncoming traffic to get around cars drivers seem to be confused about what type of vehicle belongs in the bus lane huge potholes and raised ramps make crossing these streets dangerous for wheelchairs and cyclists cars on massachusetts ave regularly speed through this intersection at 15th and run this light during morning rush hour cars turning left onto g street are extremely aggressive and often dont look for cyclists before turning ive nearly been hit more than once and on several other occasions have had to stop because of cars turning the city does not enforce no parking signs when the church on this block is in session cars park right up to the stop signs at the 4 way stops in violation of law a few times a week difficult to see around cars when turning bike lane is not painted in the one block of r street casa luca restaurant valet regularly blocks bike lane and right car lane valet for restaurant will also regularly place restaurant valet sign in bike lane at night traffic from barsrestaurants spills over into bike lane almost every night after 9 pm the bike lane has people walking through it southbound bike lane often blocked by cars double parked to drop off people at the school those same cars often pull into bike lane without signalinglooking for cyclists drivers run this light heading north on nj ave during every cycle makes it very precarious for bike traffic trying to avoid traffic that is usually speeding as well the pavement here is so filled with pot holes and seams and debris and gauges that its impossible to traverse on a bike without zigzagging which is dangerous and unpredictable in addition to buses in bike lane buses double park blocking right most lane cars constantly block the crosswalk and bicycle lane during rush hour the walk signals crossing pennsylvania northsouth in either direction no longer count down starting on green this means people start too late get stranded in the bike lanes in the median causing havoc with bikers moving legally cars always double parked passing too close speeding basically drivers make this block very dangerous motorists ignore the red leftarrow regularly here when traveling east bound on a bike often ignored by west bound vehicles turning left onto 12th st this is common throughout ny ave nw with drivers turning across the path of bikers who have a green light bicycle lane on 14th should be continued between florida and columbia nw at least northbound uphill cars are very aggressive and will pass very closely drivers especially taxis often cut across the bike lane well before the light to turn right onto 9 th st motorists do not stop for pedestrians here also it is a main crossing for people to enter the park a stop sign would make this intersection less dangerous van is often parked in l street bike lane during the early evenings loading street vendor supplies motorists do not stop for the red light those that do often block the pedestrian crossing motorists often drive much higher than is legally permitted in the conn ave tunnel under dupont circle this is incredibly unsafe especially for cyclists collision with van when they tried to pass me cycling through the intersection need bike signal or bike lead time plus there are no facilities on 16th st for cyclists illegal uturn through the bike lane morning of 62915 please add barriers to keep people on bikes safe this has gone on too long this intersection barely gives enough time for people to cross safely and the walk cycle comes very infrequently barriers along cycle track do not go completely to the bollards leaving enough room for cars to do illegal uturns through the cycletrack please remeasure the distances and correct accordingly no direct way for bikers to turn south onto 15th st track often fighting against left turning cars many bikers resort to jumping the light when it is clear would be good location for large bike box or bike specific lights motorists ignore the red rightturn arrow here motorists refuse to stop here more often than not motorists and delivery truck drivers often park across or directly behind the crosswalk making it impossible for oncoming traffic to see pedestrians until they appear from behind the parked vehicle speeding traffic this is a short block and drivers try to skip queues and try to make lights by veering off arkansas and turning on georgia or vice versa cars routinely blow through this crosswalk at 40 mph and never stop for pedestrians motorists parkdrive in the dedicated cycletrack here police officers from other jurisdictions also park here and then threaten anyone who tries to report them confusing high traffic high speed intersection have witnessed 5 accidents involving cars turning onto quincy and numerous near misses in past year cars often police or traffic enforcement but also delivery trucks cabs and regular drivers park in the bike lane with impunity motorists regularly make left turns to stay in the circle from the wrong lanes which is very dangerous for anyone who is exiting the circle from the correct lane to the drivers left there is not enough room for a parking lane a median buses cars and bikes on this street and the one before it in addition the potholes are ridiculous motorists often block the entire road here while waiting for the traffic light their vehicles point perpendicularly across the dashed lane lines for mass ave motorists often do not stop here for people trying to cross the street this intersection is terrifying cars and buses routinely take the bike lane at the very last minute not to turn but to get around cars in the lefthand turning lane this intersection is deathdefying for all concerned motorists appear not to care a whit for the presence of cyclists pedestrians or even large objects in their way motorists often drive aggressively above the speed limit here motorists often harass cyclists who get in their way on this block using aggressive honking tailgating or shouting motorists often make an illegal left on red from 20th to n motorists rarely come to a full stop at this intersection and often fail to yield to pedestrians motorists regularly make illegal uturns here cyclists in the cycletrack often cross rhode island ave when they do not have the right of way pedestrians often wait in the cycletrack while waiting for the light to change motorists travelling north on 14th turning right on rhode island often make the turn much faster than is safe due to the slighter angle on the intersection i have had to jump out of the way to avoid being hit many times here drivers stop in the middle lane of the 9th st tunnel because they refuse to wait in line for the va exit ramp block through traffic while trying to cut into the line this is incredibly dangerous pavement was damaged years ago when nmai had dumpsters parked in what is now the bike lane all summer long divots were created in the pavement that ddot will only attempt to patch this area of the roadway needs actual repair not patching infrastructure inadequate to allow bikers proceeding east on l in the bike lane to make a right on 15th delivery trucks double park here every morning motorists do not stop at the stop signs here and often do not allow pedestrians to cross drivers frequently ignore the arrow controlling the left turn and turn left across the bike lane while the arrow is red and bikes pedestrians have the right of way drivers frequently ignore the red right arrow and make right turns on red here motorists do not yield to pedestrians who cross the street from the trail further there are signs instructing trail users to yield to motor vehicle traffic which is contrary to dc law drivers frequently make turns at this intersection when it is clearly posted that no turns are permitted i take michigan through this intersection every morning on my way to work every morning i see 23 drivers run the light on 13th headed southbound during weekends it is usually less of an issue but i still often see at least 1 driver run the light protected bike lane abruptly ends forcing bicyclists into heavy traffic on street or busy sidewalks extent the bike lane south trucks double parking in bike lane constantly constant issue of double parking bike lane in this location drivers make illegal right turns on red here very often sign directing cars turning onto florida ave east or west doesnt stop cars in lane marked 4 west florida ave turning into lanes marked 4 east florida ave phys barriers guiding cars into correct turn lanes markers on all turnsst needed need 4 way stop signs on corner of 3rd v st ne cars traveling high speeds on v st ne w drivers walkers unaware only stop sign on busy intersection is on 3rd st ne parked cars near garage entrances obstruct the view of cyclists in the bike lane from motorists turning into the garages cyclists commonly have to swerve onto the sidewalk at the last minute to avoid being hit by cars turning into garages could use a bike lane here independence ave has a zillion car lanes and high speeds but no bike lane through the mall you can just ride on those streets but once you get to the capitol youre stuck again particularly bad during am rush hour cars and buses often block the southern crosswalk at this intersection this intersection is torn upcovered in gravel making it dangerous for bikes trying to turn across the intersection police car has been idling in left most lane most mornings during rush hour narrowing traffic to one lane and squeezing cars and bikers together drivers frequently ignore left turn only lane and proceed straight from both lanes at once converging dangerously as they get through the intersection car drivers turn right onto m cutting across bike lane rarely yielding to cyclists cars turn right onto m cutting across bike lane rarely yielding to cyclists delivery vehicles park in the bike lane most mornings illegal uturn through the bike lane morning of 63015 please add barriers to keep people on bikes safe mbtpedestrian crossing curvature of adjacent monroe street bridge obscures lineof sight for cars travelling westward intersection needs signal the relatively narrow street has an island in the middle with separate crossing signals if you time it wrong it can be 148 wait to cross two lanes of traffic legally during pm rush hour allnorthbound pkwy traffic pattern makes it very difficult for bikes to go from virginia ave across to the rcp bike paththompsons boathouse no xwalks on n or e leg bikes must merge left amidst freeflowing traffic this area desperately needs a crosswalk across 9th lots of speeding between 12th and eastern on michigan behind mlk library there is no slanted entryexit to the sidewalks by the exit of their parking garage and by g place making folks with wheelchairs have to use the street this block seems to be some sort of drag race spot for motorcycles esp with construction at corner of 17th and k difficult to cross safely with boxblocking bikes that go across the 14th street bridge bikepath either have to ride on the sidewalk or against traffic from maine ave sw to the lincoln memorial when crossing p street in the southerly direction the pedestrian signal is almost completely obscured by a road work sign that seems to be more or less permanent and a wayfinding sign cars go way too fast along this whole stretch as a biker very difficult and dangerous to try to turn left to get to capitol hill drivers do not stop for pedestrians at uncontrolled xwalks on macarthur blvd especially during peak periods the relatively narrow street has an island in the middle with separate crossing signals if you time it wrong it can be a long wait to cross two lanes of traffic legally turning vehicles double turn lanes do not yield to peds major pedestrian crossing spot to bms and rec centerplayground children often present very difficult to cross trail dead ends onto highway no sidewalk vehicles exiting dupont circle never yield for pedestrians crossing massachusetts ave nw and this is never enforced by mpd this intersection is unsafe especially because of the high pedestrian volumes very large delivery trucks park around both sides of the southeast corner of rhode island ave and 14th this blocks the view of motorists turning east on ri as well as motorists pulling out of the adjacent parking lot or alley cars often speed down k st eastbound in the evening coming under the train tracks where visibility is reduced putting cyclists in the roadway at risk an unsignalized pedestrian crossing should be implemented at o st nw across vermont ave nw furthermore since it is a quiet residential block the crossing should be implemented with a speed table to slow motorists exiting logan circle vehicles often roll through this stop sign when going straight or making a left onto g st left turns without complete stops or speeding are especially dangerous because it can be a blind corner and collisions have occurred with eastbound traffic motorists commonly make rapid and unsignaled turns into the church garage here forcing bike traffic to either swerve slam brakes or get sent to the hospital motorists exiting the garage rarely stop for pedestrians when they are making their highspeed uturn out of the garage into the alleyway motorists often drive their cars on the sidewalk on the west side of 19th st just south of dupont circle this typically happens after dark when there are many bargoers out who have to dive out of the way to avoid injury motorists often drive at high speeds in the alley that continues across 19th st to 20th st from jefferson pl they often dont slowstop for sidewalk pedestrian traffic in the narrow alley they often shout and honk aggressively at pedestrians southbound wisconsin drivers making right turn dont yield to pedestrians very difficult to see cars outbound on md ave and it is difficult for drivers to see pedestrians the long wait times to cross massachusetts ave nw create a situation where dozens of pedestrians are forced to wait on tiny refuge islands in busy traffic the the sidewalks along i295 exit ramp toward west bound pennsylvania ave dont have sidewalk ramps for wheel chairs or bikers to cross motorists rarely stop here for pedestrians in the crosswalk it takes a very long time to cross mass ave and l st on 11th there are multiple unsynchronized light cycles on the pedestrian signal many pedestrians give up waiting and just run across the different segments speeding drivers failure to yield to pedestrians dangerous cars drive well over the speed limit and do not stop at the crosswalk dangerous crossing into the school cars frequently speed in this block to beat the light at east capitol street constant parking violations in front of the church here signs say sunday parking ok but frequently the turn lane onto nc ave is parked up during rush hour causing a backup and safety concerns for drivers and cyclists illegal uturn by doj box truck in front of cyclists on the cycletrack poor sight lines and high traffic makes walking across constitution on mass ave very dangerous turning cars do not see you and straightaway cars swerve around turning cars needs separate turning phase with cars parked along west virginia ave it is hard to see to make left turns from oates neal and morse streets onto west virginia avenue cars tend to travel at excessive rates of speed along this road as well cars turning ontocontinuing on independence ave frequently do not wait until pedestrians have crossed likely they are racing the light at 8th and independence for cyclists traveling southeast on penn ave across 17th st to the pedestrianized plaza there are only leftturn and rightturn lanes not immediately obvious how to legally cross the street here since cyclists cant ride on the sidewalk here the storm drain and curb here are in need of repair us capitol police put fences and cones in the bike lanes here forcing cyclists into traffic the walk sign does not appear through 3 or 4 cycles of red lights it is dangerous for pedestrians to cross as cars do not slow down and generally travel and rates of speed above the speed limit delivery drivers ups fedex usps block bike lanes here all the time this narrow sidewalk puts pedestrians right up against traffic going 45mph yet its the only good ped connection between the palisades and georgetown one mirror on a from behind truck im dead bike lane on 4th st ne disappears entirely and the road becomes a 4lane freeforall unnecessarily there is a high volume of school traffic and it is almost impossible to turn left onto mount olivet rd from holbrook during morning and evening hours unsafe to cross cars too fast too little visibility over 70 second wait to cross 11th street too much priority given to speeding commuters in cars cars absolutely do not stop for pedestrians here because it can be a straight shot from 16th to 19th without stopping cars go extremely fast whne one does yield others try to swerve around the yielding car heading eastbound high pedestrian vol very wide turning radius at potomac and 17th cars do not yield to or see pedestrians very high car speeds and volumes needs bulbouts tighter turning radius very high speeds for eastbound cars here after potomac turns oneway heavy car volume here cars do not yield to pedestriansbikescrosstraffic at all uncontrolled intersection needs stop signs raised crosswalk signage something impossible to cross all 6 lanes of pennsylvania in one light cycle here bike lanes northbound disappear entirely here for 2 blocks and the road opens up to a 4lane free for all for cars forcing cyclists into nomans land independence gets nearly a 60second light cycle here even though traffic is so backed up that cars are barely even moving in the pm rush needs shorter light cycle for cars impossible to walk from e capitol bridge into the neighborhood when crossing l street on the east side of 7th cars turn from the souhtbound lane of 7th through 23 lanes of traffic they often wait for a small gap and speed through narrowly missing pedestrians frequent close passing at high speed on blind hill by drivers southbound drivers on 35th st nw usually run the stop sign at p st biking is the fastest way to reach noma metro from trinidad but theres no safe route cyclists must either bike on florida ave surrounded by speeding cars or on the gallaudet sidewalk mixing with deaf pedestrians needs bike lanes signs for staples street are blocked by treepole and other drivers continually run over the crosswalk signs in the middle of the road sidewalks are too narrow to handle the crowds of pedestrians forcing pedestrians to spill over into the street this light is so illtimed for pedestrian needs most pedestrians simply ignore it and cross whenever theres a gap in car traffic no curb cut cars gun it on independence here unsafe 6070 light cycle against pedestrians here illegal church parking in roadway every sunday church parking in roadway every sunday westbound car drivers turning right create a righthook for cyclists going straight into capitol grounds illegal uturns are bad on this block car drivers turning tofrom constitution fail to yield to pedestrians in the crosswalk here construction and delivery vehicles block the bike lane here illegal parking in the bike lanes cars turning right onto independence295 eastbound often fail to stop for pedestrians in crosswalk poor visibility with two lanes turning right creates danger for pedestrians suggest making it 1lane only for turns no good walking route to rosslyn this intersection could use a blinking light with a beg button or more signs to make cars aware that peds cross the usual scenario is 1st car stops for ped cars in other 2 lanes dont see why that car is stopping and almost run ped over missing crosswalk and light phase here for g street car drivers regularly ignore the red left turn arrow and turn illegally across northbound cyclists who have the right of way northbound drivers cut through bike lane while going around bend in 14th st nw just north of emerson cars along florida avenue rarely stop for pedestrians here especially at night when there is very low visibility lots of children in the neighborhood and this crossing is always tricky this road is unnecessarily wide for cars and difficult to cross for pedestrians the underpass here is like a highway peds frequently ignore the right turn on red and cross on the west side of 14th as the light changes right turn on red is great for cars and the flow of 14th st traffic peds need to pay more attention to walk signals cars approach this intersection much too fast many run red light others stop block crosswalk part of problem is bad design roadway curves right before crosswalk poorly timed signals cause traffic to back up blocking northside crosswalk often the entire intersection drivers turning right from k st routinely ignore posted signage barring them from trying to continue west ie making lleft turn at light many others make illegal left turn from middle lane the 15th street protected bike lane should be extended north from v st to columbia rd nw so that it is a twoway bike lane preferably protected many bicyclists go south the wrong way on that lane making it unsafe for all road users motorists on rock creek parkway often exceed the speed limit and harass cyclists who ride on the road instead of the jogging trail northbound motorists on 15th st often turn rightonred to rhode island ave without even slowing down very dangerous for all road users have never seen traffic laws enforced here drivers on i street often think intersection is a four way stop and pull in front of cars going down 13th also difficult to see if traffic is coming on 13th from i so drivers roll into crosswalk endangering pedestrians this is a very difficult intersection for pedestrians the signals favor cars on both 14th and independence and drivers routinely run red lights and block crosswalks pedestrians have a crosswalk here but cars turn right from constitution at high speeds cant see the pedestrians before they turn and do so in two lanes this turn should be eliminated cars can turn right at 18th st cars exit the parkway at high speeds a speed camera would be highly useful drivers ignore red turn arrow and turn onto vermont from circle often in the bike lane i work here and cross both of these streets at 9th e nw several times a day often 13 cars pass through the red lights at each cycle in all directions ive had to warn guests to wait 35 seconds after the walk signal lights wide intersections at 17th and u allow cars to turn onto southbound 17th at speed with poor visibility of pedestrians parked cars close to the intersection often with odd angles due to extra space increase the problem uhaul often parks its trucks illegally along the street in the morning leaving just one lane for rush hour traffic traffic often backs up to the east as far as 2nd street ne from duncan hard to see cars coming on 15th parked cars on w side of 15th block view sidewalk too narrow and blocked by utility poles sidewalk too narrow drivers turning onto the parkway do not yield to pedestrians walking along p st pedestrians and cyclists need to cross canal road here to access the co path and cct no xwalksignal to help crossing no traffic control here dangerous to cross high speed traffic only access to trails in the area this is a signed bike route but the road is too narrow for cars to pass bikers comfortably speeding cars often attempt unsafe passes or to intimidate bikers a protected bike lane would be ideal cars always in the bike lane please please continue the 14th st bike lane at least to florida its a steep downhill ride and cars take both lanes all the time cars just keep turning here blocking both bikes and pedestrians terrible connection from the end of the cycle track on g to columbus circle frequent conflicts between cyclists delivery trucks taxis and pedestrians exiting the metro station onto the narrow sidewalk very difficult to cross florida using the crosswalks at m street cars speed and rarely yield one way sections of m make it hard to connect safely with the m street cycle track from the east k street and mass ave are even worse options safer crosstown bike routes need to extend further east people walk across mt olivet from many angles tofrom montello to access the bus stop drivers waiting to turn left from penn onto 15th try to go while cyclists have green light to proceed straight to 15th st cycletrack signal needs to have red left arrow added so that drivers have firm visual cue folger theatre operates valet stands for events without proper permitting when doing so they frequently block both the bike lane and the auto lane causing cars and bikes to have to cross the double yellow to proceed there are always cars in the bike lane along 4th st sw there is no reason for through traffic to stop at this light there are no pedestrian crosswalks or cross traffic present signal timing requires cars to sit at light while watching entire green phase cycle at the next light to turn onto 1st st cars on east capitol do not stop for pedestrians with the right of way at a minimum intersection should have a fourway stop passing within 3 feet of cyclist taxicab headed south on taft bridge stop sign needed on montello heading south to cross florida between montello and 12th requires waiting for 3 different crosswalk signals at the same intersection the main signal cycle on florida only gives pedestrians 15 seconds to cross 4 lanes of traffic buses block the crosswalk daily at rush hour force pedestrians into the interaction to get around them double parking on 12th street creates dangerous situations for bikers or cars attempting to travel through double parking in front of the walmart needs to be enforced since it often aggravates the backups caused by the construction on mass3rdh speeding remains a problem along florida even with the speed camera cars using west virginia as a cut through to and from new york frequently speed cars going northbound on 12th often try to beat the light as it changes posing a risk to cyclists and pedestrians crossing at e difficult turning on and off of g street from maryland for cyclists and cars i live on this block and i really think there should be a 4way stop sign here people think this is a 4way stop and there are so many close calls every day because people just stop and then roll through without looking it is very dangerous i occasionally see cars heading north on alaska think the eastbound green for kalmia is for them ive been inseen a few close calls where im heading east on kalmia on a green when someone heading up alaska enters the intersection on a red bikes proceeding on east capitol st must make a right turn and then move over two lanes to make the left around the park drivers frequently cut you off from behind intersection needs a bike box and signage to yield to turning bikes motorists frequently fail to stop for pedestrians at all unsignaled crossing on the park including especially at this intersection where motorists turning right do not stop for pedestrians going straight on east capital the ped signal for crossing ny ave on east side of intersection is a deathtrap the twoway protected bike lane on 15th ends here and forces bicyclists to move to the left side of the road to continue legally for one block where the one way north bike lane begins again on the hill the bike lane should not end there construction is completely blocking the sidewalk on the west side of 20th st on for the southern half of the block between m st and n st doubleparking in the bike lanes is rampant in front of the hotel here both for taxis and delivery trucks this forces cyclists out into traffic unsafe cars park illegally by the bikeshare docks and the bike racks this creates poor visibility for pedestrians and cyclists and forces southbound cyclists directly into oncoming car traffic two lanes sebound on mass ave merge chaotically into one lane here pinching bicyclists and encouraging car drivers to speed and jockey for position double parking on this block of penn is the rule not the exception to get from southside maryland ave ne into stanton park at 6th ne people on foot need to cross maryland ave ne which has a right turn only cycle 6th ne and c st ne which has a short pedestrian cycle stop all cars and let people walk people driving cars are speeding up rather than stopping at the cross walk bc it is just before they merge into 395 meanwhile it is the only way for families in sw to ride a bicycle over to the polo fields or the mt vernon trail speeding vehicles on piney branch especially southbound often fail to yield to pedestrians crossing at dahlia also cars parked in front of the church obscure visibility of northbound vehicles for peds crossing from east to west the cross walk button appears to be broken or it just takes way too long drivers on c ne get a left arrow to turn onto 6th ne due to longer green cycles at c ne and maryland ave drivers run this red light frequently school park playground and library foot traffic are all affected the long wait to cross south capital street makes this route impossible to use in the morning when parents and kids are trying to ride bikes to school due to red light running and rightonred traffic the walk time crossing 6th between stanton park mass ave is not enough for all walkers to safely cross many run surprising drivers bike lane is too narrow narrower than allowed under federal guidelines this makes it very difficult for cyclists to stay in the bike lane thus they often drift into the regular lane cars dont expect this since they a bike lane is there every day over a dozen people driving cars make an illegal left turn from 4th to m and almost hit people crossing the street there is no visible enforcement of the no left turn which is dangerous tour bus drivers often run people off the road when the are turning right from 4th to independence the drivers get much closer than 3 ft from the people on bikes on a regular basis there is no marked path to go up the hill from this station and go towards the mall people on bikes end up using the cross marked area which is filled with double parked cars half the time it is very dangerous the cross walk in front of the school is often blocked with people sitting in idling cars cars turning north from new hampshire onto 22nd st constantly disregard pedestrians crossing with signal at nw corner of l and 22nd to nw corner of 22nd and new hampshire the signal allows the cars to go 1st but they dont stop turning i do not feel safe riding from union station to the mall people in cars drive too fast the bicycle lanes do not connect and the safe routes are blocked by barricades around the senate office buildings the cross walk takes forever to get from union station to f st and there is no direct cross walk so everyone jaywalks to get to f st this needs a redesign the pedestrian signal on ct btw ordway and newark is great but you could grow old and die before the light changes so a lot of peds go ahead and jaywalk double parking and tourist buses jockeying for parking spaces in the west side parking lane makes this a very dangerous place to bike especially when drivers get frustrated with blocked lanes drivers traveling eastbound on irving routinely bully their way through crossing pedestrians when turning south illegal parking in the bike lane which 311 refuses to enforce please see their seeclickfix app for proof that because there arent no parking signs here they wont enforce the no parking in bike lanes law cars often park in the indent of the cycletrack on m street blocking both lanes of the bikeway cars often park in the cycletrack at the entrance to this driveway blocking both lanes of the bikeway the lpi on the crosswalks is useless here without making the intersection no turn on red cars are frequently rushing into the cross walk when the light is red because the just missed the green and want to turn before opposing direction goes car drivers barrel down 19th st well above the legal speed limit cars fly down montello ave and someone is going to get hit speed bumps would be really great on this street speeding here is dangerous riding my bike in my own neighborhood feels like im taking my life in my own hands cars drive too fast through the neighborhood someone is going to get hit and with the all the kids in the neighborhood its very dangerous for them cars go too fast near school its dangerous no reasonable accommodation for pedestrians on the east side of connecticut in front of the park van ness project many pedestrians do not cross to the west side and walk in the traffic lane motorists drive too fast on this bridge very dangerous for cyclists as well as for the few motorists who do obey the speed limit motorists park their vehicles in the 14th st bike lane it is perpetual rarely do i see a block without a motor vehicle parkedstopped in the bike lane this weird intersection is a terrific place to speed and a terrible place to walk when ddot retimed the traffic lights on pennsylvania ave it more than doubled my commute time i get stopped by every single light and im a pretty fast cyclist drivers turning right on red southbound onto georgia at this light ignore crossing pedestrians as they nudge out into the crosswalk to get a clear sight line needs no turn on red crosswalk here is never ever respected yield to pedestrian sign in the roadway is hit and destroyed once a month needs a light or hawk no sidewalks no curb cuts cars speeding too fast unsafe to cross pennsylvania ave no curb cut from bridge path to banneker circle wheelchairs and bicyclists have no choice here delivery driver parked in bike lane 1035 am 7115 said he has been doing it for 5 years and isnt going to stop regularly encounter drivers using the bike lane to double park street intersection with no crosswalk pedestrians cross from ward place to the park to access m street at all times of day car drivers turning from the circle onto mass ave eastbound routinely violate the red arrow cars travelling east on u st run the red light while turning left north onto 16th street the bike light is short so cyclists moving s on nh need to go quickly to get across resulting in many nearmisses cars frequently turn right on red sometimes without really slowing down even though there is a sign prohibiting them from doing so drivers including metrobus rarely stop at this stop sign my wife was struck and injuredhead injury by a vehicle driver in 2013 at sherman circle the driver just came around the circle too fast and didnt see her in the crosswalk there are signs here but they are not enough needs better design trying to walk westbound under the circle can take up 15 minutes from m st must cross 4 lights across mass across 14th to an island from island to another island and from the second island to vermont theres a green arrow that seems to be tilted to point at northbound ga ave traffic but is actually meant for westbound mo ave traffic that is extremely confusing cars are constantly double parked or just standing on this short street pedestrians along the entire length of the block pop out from between cars to cross the problem is especially bad on weekends often there are 20 or more pedestrians waiting to cross k st on the north side but car drivers get a green arrow to turn north from k onto ct lots of conflicts as pedestrian crowding is a problem right outside farragut north biking all along florida avenue is pretty treacherous during morning rush hour i generally bike down montello avenue ne and cross florida avenue towards k street i make a loop towards cap hill as to avoid florida ave in the morning 65second light cycle favoring speeding cars on independence here beg button for pedestrians is little help the long cycle encourages jaywalking beg button to cross 11th st here on south side of o st se does not function you just have to cross against the red turn arrow and hope the cars exiting the navy yard yield to you car drivers going from 17th to penn fail to yield to pedestrians in the crosswalks at barney circle bicyclists must cross and merge across a slip lane at high speeds here slip lanes need a full stop sign no way for pedestrians to cross at the east side of this bridge pedestrians do it anyway and have to dodge highspeed traffic vision zero must make allowances for the fact that people want to and will cross here on foot even if not allowed cars frequently run the light here when trying to turn left from mass ave to 2nd street endangering pedestrians there is a general backup so it also happens at other left turns and going straight crosswalk is located 12 block south of crossing location the painted crosswalk connects two service garages that are rarely used pedestrian path from 23rd street connects across to ward place and no crosswalk is located here cars speed regularly on missouri ave and do not obey crosswalks serious danger to pedestrians cars turning left from eastbound on u to northbound on 16th or new hampshire often end up turning after their light has turned red during the bike green signal the bike green is too short to wait for left turning cars and then get safely through cars fly along this residential block sometimes racing to catch the green light because its a residential street there are often pedestrians crossing midblock from parked cars or houses there are also many children around traveling south on the west sidewalk of south capitol here is scary there is a ramp where cars could pull off the road at high speed and hit me but theyre coming from behind so its difficult to check the street before crossing here two lanes coming off of m st southbound share a light with traffic driving under m st on s capitol of these two lanes only the left most lane is able to continue onto s capitol while the right hand lane must turn right this is continually ignored southbound 13th street is a very rough surface with numerous asphalt heaves this is a very dangerous intersection for bikers coming down the hill there is not enough time to cross here at evening rush hour and the pedestrian signs only work if you push the button but it doesnt say that on the button sign when it rains water often pool on this section of lincoln rd ne this causes drivers to try to drive around it often going into incoming cars lane lack of stop sign on 10th st in southbound direction creates unsafe situation for crossing pedestrians and traffic there is not enough time to cross here and then you have to compete against all of the cars that are turning this is much worse because of the construction of the museum of african american history which has closed off the north sidewalk tourist motor coaches regularly block the bike lane really bad in the morning by north bound cars the cars going left onto h st often push through huge pedestrian crowds button for pedestrians to press is behind a fence on the west side of 17th street once the fence is removed after the 4th of july the button is still out of reach for a wheelchair user on the sidewalk cars speed here during afternoon rush very dangerous for bikes lots of car drivers turn left on 16th at rush hour they block the mixing zone forcing cyclists to maneuver into traffic and out of the protected cycle lane should just have a protected lane with no mixing zone and a green arrow for cars this is a heavy pedestrian use area next to the lincoln memorial a tourist presses the walk button and wait an amazingly long time for the light to change sadly the out of town tourists run into the street rather than waiting it is impossible for a pedestrian to cross both east and west bound lanes of independence avenue in one light cycle unfortunately tourists frequently jay walk the vehicle traffic moves very very fast here creating a dangerous situation the memorial bridge has no separation between pedestrians and vehicles i can not find any speed signs vehicles regularly go very very fast just inches away from the pedestrians i have never seen speed enforcement on this bridge the biker specific light for bikers south bound on new hampshire seems to take forever even if parked in the signal sensors once the light finally changes there is enough time for only two bikes to reach the bike box on southbound 16th st cars frequently drive the wrong way south on 4th street into the intersection to cut around traffic getting onto the 395 ramp this dangerous for pedestrians and drivers alike cars turning right onto constitution do not yield to pedestrians cars and buses go way over the 15 mph speed limit rock creek church road nw needs lane markings across the intersections with 3rd street and shepherd street in order to guide drivers traveling southwest along the roadway dangerous to enterexit vehicles parked along the roadway without these lanes vehicles speed around circle and even around cars stopped for pedestrians in crosswalk need to narrow the circle to only one lane cars go way too fast here in the afternoon cars turning right do not yield to pedestrians cars on this stretch are either stopped or speeding the light cycles between 1st union station garage bike lane north and pedestrian crossing each segment has a short time to cross so peds cars and bikes regularly ignore the light the light in the north south direction lasts more than a minute while the east west light barely lasts 20 seconds the 4th st bike lane is a defacto car lane for cars dodging to the right to get around left hand turning vehicles its very dangerous for bikes and there are many cars who run the red light in the bike lanes we bike to school with kids cyclists most of them on capital bikeshare bikes blow through the stop sign at all times even when lots of pedestrians are present drivers speed through arkansas constantly cars block the lanes at this intersection northbound in the morning making it hard for bikes to cross bikes then have to go between cars and they are not seen by the cars taking a left onto 17th street from pennsylvania pedestrian crosswalk here cyclists ride in the sidewalk in violation of rules regarding cbd sidewalk cycling and when theres a bike line right there delivery trucks park in the bike lane here almost every morning there is no real trail here for walkersbikersrunners other than a desire line that is extremely uneven access to rock creek park should be allotted for all users including peds need a bike box here in front of the cars the light timing here encourages drivers heading south to speed between the light at c 11th ne and the light at constitution 11th ne change the timing or better yet replace the 11th const light with a stop sign bicyclists often go the wrong way down this one way street during the morning rush hour cars turning onto westbound g st se have a stop sign but rarely stop because theyre coming off a green light right before that at kentucky to get from k street to washington circle you have to wait at four different lights and you have to zig zag back and forth in an irrational manner the service lane means that pedestrians have only a very short signal to cross ordway and go from the metro to the cleveland park shopping strip the direction traffic comes from is confusing and many cars speed to beat the long light especially bad in the afternoon trying to cross the south side of i st the light cycle here takes forever in the morningpeople routinely jaywalk because it otherwise requires waiting 2 minutes to get from the bus to metro drivers turning left from conn ave start speeding and often come close to hitting pedestrians cars speed to turn right from porter to connecticut with the protected signal pedestrians have a long time to wait and often think its safe to cross when in fact right turns are permitted seen several near misses drivers fly down 4th and cut across t many barely stop and most fail to look both ways for pedestrians cars headed west on north carolina to turn left onto third often ignore peds crossing third the large intersection makes it easy to speed and hard to see pedestrians many cars seem to become confused and collide into the traffic light on the traf drivers dont see the red light intended to stop wb fl ave traffic and allow peds to cross fl and eb ny ave traffic to turn onto fl wb many near misses at this confusing and dangerous intersection tree boxes on k street south make the side walk extremely narrow and impassible for people with disabilities and children in strollers crossing macomb on the west side of connecticut is too far cars speed down macomb to make the right turn but as a pedestrian you arent always sure if they are stopping at the light or about to do a rolling stop bulb outs here would help cars going north on 22nd street blow through this heavyped intersection drivers fly down the off ramp and fail to yield to peds on d street it is absurd that there is no sidewalk here paths on either end of this section just end into nothing people run or walk in the road when the grass is muddy pedestrians crossing in the crosswalk confront 4 lanes of traffic at the top of a hill cars in middle lanes who stop obscure the pedestrians and cars in outside lanes speed to get around them this spot will kill someone no safe way for cyclists to get from 10th and 12th brookland side through the 7thfranklin intersection edgewood side we bike to school with kids and this is a terrible pinch point potholes and very rough pavement missing sidewalk on 13th from quincy to perry also missing sidewalks on two sides of the park cyclists go the wrong way down this one way street in the bike lane cars to do not stop at stop sign cars speed on this section of e street cars speed in excess of the 15 mph speed limit to make the very short light at the intersection of 15th then they brake suddenly to avoid hitting pedestrians trying to cross 14th street within 18 seconds lots of neardooring along 11th every time i turn right or left from corbin onto 13th its with a prayer its a blind turn in both directions cars are parked too close to intersection often there are large school groups crossing this intersection and they do not ever get across in time because the light is short tour buses unload here in the morning blocking the bike lane cars make illegal right on reds here almost ever single cycle they often dont even bother stopping the traffic lights here to continue north on overlook ave and ender jbab appear to be triggered for cars and without a car to trigger the light they do not give a green for bikers to continue onto the base this intersection is too wide for pedestrians to cross safely and the signal cycle is unreasonably long cars frequently run the red light as a result and make illegal right on red turns drivers traveling from washington circle onto 23rd frequently run the red arrow or turn right on a red arrow in the evenings it can be difficult to see pedestrians who want to cross the street at the crosswalk if the curb protruded further into the street with no cars parked nearby it might be easier also more streetlights there are no bike lanes here so bikers have to ride in the shoulder on southbound overlook ave the shoulder goes out where the turn lane for nrl comes in frequently cars and buses cut in front of bikes to get into the turn lane vehicles block the bicycle lane and pedestrian crossing causing an unsafe circus for peds and bikers cars dont always stop for both pedestrians and cyclists morning and afternoon this intersection is dangerous for pedestrian drivers typically run the red light and block the crossing due to the backup at 7th street this intersection needs a camera when heading we on wv you cant see cross traffic on 8th which doesnt stop cars entering freeway cross pedestrian crosswalk at highway speeds dangerous for pedersatirans drivers regularly enter the intersection when it is obvious they will not be able to clear it before the light turns red they then block the box and crosswalks the pedestrian walk signal is shifted to show walk when the actual signal should be stop its either on monroe park or maybe lamont very dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists who are following the pedestrian signal the construction activities on 1st st are continuously blocking the bike lane without providing a safe alternative tour buses regularly block the metro bus stop on northbound connecticut ave after florida this forces metrobuses to pick updrop off from a lane of traffic which is an ada issue and a traffic safety issue intersection at school is dangerous southside sidewalk from 6th to 9th is impassible for those with accessibility issues the sidewalk is so narrow that any pedestrians on that side of street are in danger of being clipped by a side mirror cars often aggressively pass bikes here trying to get onto the d st bike lane dangerous intersection with difficulty seeing pedestrians and few vehicles stop for them its a direct waking path to the metro and pedestrian cars use 6th st nw as a shortcut and have difficulty seeing bikes pedestrians and other cars when turning south or crossing onto butternut st nw deadending this street at butternut st nw would eliminate this unsafe intersection speeding along e capitol in front of school every morning from 710 am often reckless the traffic lights here appear to be triggered for cars and without a car to trigger the light they do not give a green for bikers to continue to ride north or south along brookley ave drivers turning left from m to 21st frequently take this left at high speeds and fail to yield to pedestrians in the crosswalk and pedestrian please place a barrier between blair rd nw and dahlia st nw5th st nw to remove dangerous angle as speeding cars often use 5th st nw as shortcut but dont look for bikes and pedestrians crossing the street the traffic lights here appear to be triggered for cars and without a car to trigger the light they do not give a green for bikers to continue to ride north or south along newly installed 19th st crosswalk is terribly placed and unsafe cars frequently roll through this stop sign please deadend this street at blair rd nw cars turning right from w on mass to n on new jersey often do not even slow to make right on red it is very dangerous for when cars take this corner at high speeds without looking for pedestrians the crosswalks here are not signaled cars rarely stop for pedestrians the most problematic are cars using the protected rightturn from southbound overlook those turning right from the highway onto northbound overlook while there is a hawk signal here not enough pedestrians know how to use it more signs might help the alley entrance here is really really wide which encourages drivers to make turns across the sidewalk faster than is safe louisiana is the connection between the mbt1st st bike lane and the mall however speeding is so bad here that many bicyclists use the sidewalk instead of riding in 35 mph traffic trucks using the loading dock at this apartment building often block the crosswalk and sometimes the cycletrack as well pedestrians are forced to walk in the street double parking is a big issue along this block it impedes traffic for both drivers and bikers there are many nearmisses at this intersection drivers turning right from 15th onto constitution are impatient and squeeze through pedestrians crossing in the crosswalk police cars driving on the bike trail have ruined the sidewalk and create safety issue because bikes can not see police cars on trail from fort totten dr ne please add bollards or other barrier to prevent illegal sidewalk driving by police drivers coming out of the tunnel and turning right onto constitution frequently fail to yield to pedestrians drivers never stop for this cross walk i have to start crossing and just hope someone slams on brakes and be ready to jump back if they dont lots of moms with strollers or toddlers use this crosswalk to get to bus stops long distance to cross for pedestrians and drivers on 4th st making the island at allison st larger would help as would bump outs at the painted pedestrian crossing both could be done with out effecting parking impossible to see cars coming from either direction because of the street parking on nh ave thats spans all the way up to the intersection with crittenden there should be a larger noparking buffer cyclist constantly run this light when southbound on 11th st and its impossible to see the traffic entering from the northeast on vermont ranges from merely rude to very dangerous based on whether anyone is coming how fast etc drivers heading south on 18th and turning left act very aggressively towards pedestrians in the crosswalk with the right of way could use contraflow lane to connect to the driveway just to the east of here cyclists often ride against traffic because the sidewalk is full of people obviously an issue at certain times of year more than others when the white house complex is closely for security it is difficult for people on bikes to access the 15th st cycle track adding 2 short cycle tracks on h st nw and 15th st nw would help immensely pedestrians going north crossing massachusetts are often cut off by cars making a right turn on red from 17th to mass even though pedestrians have a walk signal and the cars will later have their own green turn arrow nearly every block of the 5th st bike lane between the circle and rock creek church road has a giant run running through it numerous potholes debris from a lack of street sweeping on 5th ave cyclist have to weave in and out of traffic lane drivers routinely floor is to go down this long block that has wide lanes and minimal street parking its difficult to parallel park pull in or out of the local business driveways or cross as a pedestrian needs a speed hump crosswalk one of the most dangerous intersections in the city drivers frequently ignore pedestrians in the crosswalk and drive right through red lights along this stretch of 4th street are poorly times most mornings i get caught at every light between the mall and m st sw i bike south in the morning the driveway is twice as wide as the alley itself cars treat this like a freeway onramp which is unsafe the driveway was also repaved and has this awkwardly steep angle on one section so this part could just be totally removed ive crossed this intersection everyday for years and not once seen a driver yield for pedestrians at the crosswalk jbab has decided to use automatic gates that will not detect bikes this forces bikers to enter using the pedestrian gate and then reenter traffic on the other side so much speeding sometimes pedestrians have to wait a minute or more for cars to stop here and even when southbound cars get caught at the light with georgia ave drivers pile into the crosswalk leaving tiny spaces for pedestrians to scoot through speeding erratic driving no enforcement someone was killed here recently still nothing lots of foot traffic at this intersection crossing lincoln on u st headed tofrom bloomingdale shops cars on lincoln tend to fly through the intersection trying to make the light at ri and dont see pedestrians until its late to slow down u street from 16 to 9 sure would make a nice pedestrian mall impossible for a car exiting this alley to see traffic thats coming down gallatin from across new hampshire there should be no street parking between the alley and the light on the north side of the street lots of foot traffic at this intersection crossing n cap on ri ave headed tofrom bloomingdale shops its an unpleasant intersection ive had several near misses with cars racing to make left turns from ri to n cap accidents are too common here walking underneath the underpass is frightening but the only way to get tofrom the shops at ri row from eckington the sidewalk is very narrow its dark and cars go through at ridiculously high speeds the crosswalk light and street light are timed so pedestrians heading from the mass ave corner to the island are forced to cross when oncoming traffic has a green light drivers behave aggressively especially during rush hour sewer drain is entirely blocked by dirt and debris so when it rains the whole street is flooded and pedestrians or wheelchair users can not cross at ne corner of 17 n sts nw there are two lanes of eastbound q street west of massachusetts avenue both with straight arrows painted on the pavement cars in the left lane often turn right onto massachusetts ave space is tight especially when the bushes have not been trimmed could use a wider path to avoid bikebike conflicts many red light runners on southbound 16th street or from colesville road at the north portal drive intersection people use the bike lane as their personal valet service on this block of upshur dangerous to ride on the sidewalkpath sometimes especially during summer but also feels dangerous to many to ride with traffic on the street between the 15th st cycletrack and 14th st bridge crossing piney branch rd nw is difficult here because the pedestrian signal is not automatic you have to see the sign telling you that you must push the button even if you push the button cars frequently ignore it and even honk at peds in crosswal valet drop off for school kids blocked bike lanes cars also failed to yield for pedestrians and bikes in the crosswalk or turning onto the trail not sure if they had proper permits the pedestrian crossing signal runs on a very long cycle at georgia and otis nw if you do not catch it at the right part of the light cycle it can seem to take a very long time to get a walk sign encouraging pedestrians to disregard the signal fast and impatient cars and rapid light sequencing pushes bikers to the sidewalk posing conflicts between bikers and walkers no way for bikers or pedestrians to cross police cars frequently drive on multiuse trail as shortcut to their police station they are not authorized to do and are breaking the law please add bollards to prevent this light is timed to give peds only about 8 seconds to cross ri ave no way to get from the mt vernon trail to the north side of memorial bridge there is a wornin trail but the park service keeps blocking it fix the issue cars make a right onto ri ave from 4th without yielding to pedestrians there is a daycare on this corner which compounds the dangers here frequently illegal parking often by police officers eating lunch crossing 15th on the south side of w allows for 21 seconds of crossing time every 120 i walk very fast and i can still barely cross 15th in 21 seconds too much double parking discourages bikes from using this street many illegal parkers are police cars cars frequently fail to stop for pedestrians in the crosswalk because they can not see them until it is too late would be nice to have visual cue about how bicyclists should be traveling to connect between sections of the cycletrack currently dangerous for peds and bikes through the plaza arealafayette cars frequently park and double park to pick up passengers from the metro please add a cycle track and a 15 minute parking lane eastbound m st traffic turning onto key bridge nearly always runs the red light its because drivers drive too fast and the lights are hard to see cars frequently double park to drop off people at the metro this intersection in front of georgetown university is a mess too many drivers stand in random places picking up or dropping of passengers while blocking traffic meanwhile pedestrians and bikers have to try and wiggle themselves between the cars bike lanes frequently blocked with no enforcement the curb cut on the northwest corner of this intersection sticks out really far and it looks like the right lane of nwbound mass ave is too narrow drivers routinely clip the curb and nearly hit pedestrians standing at the edge of the sidewalk try turning left from eastound pa ave onto the l st bikelane i have no clue how to do that safely drivers speed down pa ave and as a biker i have to get to the left lane to get onto l st drivers on 12th routinely speed through this intersection weave around each other speed up when the light turns yellow and fail to yield to pedestrians when turning left onto i st bicyclists on t street constantly running through 4way stop sign despite limited visibility due to parked vehicles potholes and road irregularities pose serious cycling risks lack of stop signs wide lanes and unused parking lanes encourage speeding on this section of interim metropolitan branch trail cyclists often speed down sidewalk going downhill and fail to yield to pedestrians cars frequently make illegal right on red turns despite poor visibility due to hill and bikers using interim mbt this is one of the many many terribly designed dc intersections i know its been redone recently but it did not get better drivers speed and its utterly unclear where people are going cars go super fast down 400500 kenyon and irving very difficult crossing as a pedestrian being seen need clear designated cross time or perhaps diagonal crossing and more time for pedsbikes bike lane ends before intersection which encourages drivers to encroach on bikers space please add bike lane through this stop sign and add bollard protection traveling eastbound on princeton to make a right onto park place with cars parked on street it is difficult to see oncoming traffic and cyclists unless you pull through the crosswalk and well into the bike lane hard for a car turning from quincy st to rock creek church rd to see cars coming down the hill to their left due to onstreet parking pedestrian signals are out of sync between the two 24th st nw crossings at the intersection with connecticut ave nw this often leads to pedestrians getting stuck in the middle of the intersection or jaywalking wamta buses often block the bike lane this means that bikers needs to merge with drivers in a dangerous and chaotic intersection the entire l st bike lane is a disaster because it is on the left side of the road it leads to conflicts with drivers at every intersection furthermore many drivers park in the bike lane please close this street access to fort totten dr ne cars use this cut through to access fort totten dr ne at bikerdriver expense already on street cars can not see bikescarspeds on street and pull out blindly causing many near misses cars consistently do not stop for pedestrians and are often hostile toward pedestrians the ellipse could be a beautiful park for pedestrians with nice bike lanes instead it is a overflow parking lot for the white house booo very very scary intersection to cross police cars frequently double park in front of their station it is hard to enforce something if the enforcers are breaking the law too signal cycle is too biased towards cars coming off the highway and is not long enough for more than 23 cars on 5th st se to cross long signal times encourage bikers to run red light this whole intersection is difficult to bike on the sidewalk because some lines of sight are poor and some righthooks the result is very unpredictable moves from both runners and bikers this signal takes too long and as a result many pedestrians and bikes cross against the light significant rat infestation next to bus stop on south side of massachusetts trash cans exacerbate problem pedestrians need a crosswalk somewhere between i and m street commuters are backed up on north capitol and use adams and bryant streets to get around the traffic with construction the speed limit is 15mph however cars routinely speed through on their commutes in the morning vehicles often run the red light especially travellling north at this intersection often almost hitting pedestrains who have started to cross parking is allowed next to this crosswalk but the parked cars make it difficult to see whether a pedestrian is waiting to cross the parking spot should be removed which would allow bikers and drivers to better see pedestrians and to stop for them cars often fail to notice the midblock crosswalk with traffic light and drive straight through red lights there is so much illegal parking all around judiciary square many of the cars claim to have something to do with the police the put placards or hats on the dashboard its really quite shocking that this is permitted usps vehicles often double parked blocking the right lane delivery trucks often parked in front of cvs i have repeatedly seen cars parked illegally on this bridge over the freeway although they are not cop cars they usually have some indication that they belong to a cop or a cops family member so thats probably why they are not ticketed bs bike lane disappears cars want tu turn right onto 695 danger to bikers in morning rush hour adding a bike lane to columbia road would help to cut down on the wrongway riding that necessarily occurs on the sidewalk now i have nearly been hit numerous times by drivers turning left while in the crosswalk walking across florida ave towards gallaudet its a dangerous intersection for pedestrians a left turn only arrow would be very helpful here the wait to cross over 4th street is very long and then when the light does change it is too short intersection should have crosswalk at every crossing point drivers regularly fail to yield to pedestrians at the crosswalk as they exit from 17th onto new york ave the slip lane exit encourages vehicles to speed through the crosswalk drivers northsouthbound on columbia road regularly blow through the stop signs at this intersection it is very dangerous for pedestrians mid block cross walk going southbound drivers speed up after passing the traffic light at u and 14 and often times do not see the mid block cross walk to reduce their speed or slow down the two ped signals for crossing the westbound eastbound lanes of ny ave arent synced well going south forcing people to crowd in the median to wait for the second walk sign also confuses drivers who have a green arrow but think they must yield the construction activity at the corner of new jersey and i has blocked view of the stop signs and covered up the crosswalks this interesection is now very dangerous to cross in all directions there should be a crosswalk across 6th street from on the north side of this intersection there is no crosswalk on the south side of windom this forces all pedestrians to walk to the north side this is especially problematic given the nearby metro entrance closure and sidewalk closure broken curbs and no crosswalk ramps make for a difficult crossing to the playground short pedestrian signal on sb side of washington ave sw with left turns now being permitted from wb independence ave sw makes this a dangerous mess whole intersection really needs to be reworked given additional turning movements allowed now broken curbs are a hazard when parking cars the street basically disappears into the grass along this block with pieces of broken pavement laying in the road high pedestrian traffic area between gallaudet university and union market multiple failures of motorists to stop for pedestrians also speeding at this unsignaled crosswalk back from the intersection cars frequently fail to stop for pedestrians despite presence of signs indicating they must do so greater visibility for pedestrians or some actual enforcement of traffic laws please very unsafe crossing almost all other intersections in the area are 4way stops which creates confusion at this 2way stop also its hard to see traffic crossing in both directions everyone treats the stop sign as a yield difficult to see nh ave traffic on both sides of emerson st the angle of traffic makes visibility difficult parking on nh needs to be moved back to allow a better field of vision pavement is poor and tight many dump trucks and cars pass too close to cyclists this is supposed to be the temporary mbt the new traffic lights here southbound on 5th are terrible its impossible to tell if the light is green yellow or red doesnt this defeat the purpose of having a traffic light in the first place traffic often backs up in the evenings especially when cars traveling north are trying to turn left cyclists with room to pass traffic on the right are routinely in danger of cars trying to pass the vehicle turning left or cars turning right there isnt a stop sign at this intersection going northsouth on 6th street leading to cars going high speeds in that direction as a pedestrian and bicyclist going down a this can lead to a pretty hazardous situation to cross connecticut ave at windom pedestrians must engage a beg button and wait for the light to change the crossing light then lasts 20 seconds hundreds now cross daily to get tofrom the metro from the north drivers regularly park in the no parking zone on nb connecticut ave after dupont circle when they do this buses can not make the turn from the circle to connecticut and it backs up traffic once it was a park police officer getting coffee cars routinely run the stop sign here to make it onto michigan ave its just a confusing intersection for all parties involved the service lane along connecticut ave creates carpedestrian conflicts and leaves little room on the sidewalk for pedestrians it is very difficult to cross michigan ave ne at these crosswalks because cars speed along the street and dont stop for pedestrians cars move way too fast down this street large amount of cutthrough car traffic plus pedestrians crossing plus bicycle traffic makes this a very dangerous intersection when those cars then do not stop completely and often ignore rightofway rules which is often especially rush hours the double parkingvalet parking on northbound connecticut ave before dupont circle needs to be stopped it is nearly impossible for cars to get into the lanes that go to dupont circle in the evening cars turning onto taylor street from 7th or puerto rico often have to wait a very long time for a green light sometimes the light turns red for taylor street drivers but doesnt turn green for taylor and puerto rico this intersection is confusing and poorly designed especially for those driving westbound on u street i rarely see other cars actually using the correct lanes to turn get to florida ave or 18th st visibility is poor on all intersections involving angled streets parking needs to be moved further up the street so crossing vehicles can see oncoming traffic without inching into the lane the bus lane markingssigns should be eliminated this is not enforced at all there are just as many cars in the bus lane as the other lane all it does it teach drivers to ignore bus lanes broken curbs and no crosswalk ramps make for a difficult crossing to the park the nw corner of connecticut and albemarle has been rounded to effectively make the road four lanes wide compared to 3 lanes wide on the east side this encourages sb drivers on connecticut to make wide turns or wb albemarle traffic to speed cars block this entire intersection every afternoon forcing cyclists and pedestrians to try to weave their way through them and blocking oncoming car traffic entirely heading south bike lane disappeared two blocks before and bikes sharing full lane shared lane turns into a right turn lane this is a problem for bikers heading straight south on 11th st large generator on a trailer partially blocks crosswalk and limits line of sight has been in place for several months for some reason the crosswalk across the east side of i st where it intersects with 22nd was jackhamered up and there are no crossing signs people still cross there everyday because its a logical place to cross the street bicycle lane nb on 4th st sw is interrupted just north of intersection with i st sw and does not resume for 2030 up the street when originally installed it did connect but then segment of bike lane was removed and parking reinstalled difficult to enter 6th street via the gallaudet university gate blocked view due to carsbikes parked cant see oncoming traffic left turn onto 6th street southbound very dangerous due to speeders and very few breaks in traffic cars park on the sidewalk cars block most of sidewalk wheelchairs unable to get around cars damage to bricks makes walking hazardous crossing pen ave on the east side of 22nd st is damgerious the penn ave light is too long and the 22nd light too short since the hospital is close there are a number of elderly or handicaped persons that cross here and need more time this light going across 7th st is so fast theres barely enough time to get across even if youre very quick about it and its nearly impossible if youre walking a dog delivery trucks block the entire sidewalk forcing pedestrians into the street near an intersection where cars turn too fast to see them there is a chronic problem of cyclists riding on the sidewalk in this area its a very congested sidewalk area already with all the bars restaurants and apartments and cyclists on the sidewalk are very dangerous ive been hit and seen others hit drivers ignore the stop signs and crosswalks at this intersection a lot of cars run this light and some do not even stop for the light in addition to rampant speeding drivers on 19th street rarely yield to pedestrians waiting to cross to the stadiumarmory metro station cyclists often ride counterflow along this stretch of the r street bike lane between mass ave and 21st street this puts the wrongway cyclist in danger people blow through these stop signs a lot either trying to avoid traffic by zooming down nicholson st or trying to make the light at 5th and missouri there are many small children in the area a connection to the mbt here would make for a better walk to the metro from this area no safe way to cross this bridge on a bike the sidewalk is narrow and in poor repair the roadway has heavy traffic that seldom notices cyclists cyclists ride against the oneway westbound traffic flow typically in the oneway westbound bike lane this endangers all road users often causing conflict between cyclists following the law and those who want to avoid sheriden circle there has been large loose gravel in the bike lane around a curve for at least several months it is dangerous and should be cleaned up bike lanes here are often strewn with gravel glass and trash making them unsafe crossing lanes eb pennsylvania ave on south side of potomac ave is a long wait for a very short signal and is a frequent source of conflict with drivers turning right from potomac onto pennsylvania as well with the short signal time a small of drivers do not seedo not understand the turning arrow to make a left onto n st creating a hazard for cyclists in the bike lane a sign stating left turn on green arrow only might clear up the confusion please extend the bike lanes on 3rd st cars do not respect the bike lane space heading into thomas circle they regularly veer into the bike lane even when bikes are present the sidewalk is broken here and has been repaired but the repairs have worn away so that there are large holes where there is no concrete or asphalt this makes passage difficult for those in wheelchairs or those on bicycles too many cars in the bus and bike lane every evening this intersection is blocked with cars going down florida there needs to be clear lines where to stop at the floridai storren light to prevent traffic cars illegally park too close to the crosswalk blocking the line of site cars tend to speed up to make it through this intersection and have nearly been hit several times when i had a cross signal it doesnt help that the signal to cross this street is short this is an incredibly dangerous intersection for pedestrians due to the combination of a wide turning radius freeway type speeds on 17th and the lack of a no turn on red sign for traffic on 17th it needs bulbouts no turn on red sign bicyclist do not stop at the sign coming southbound on 11th st or eastbound on t its dangerous for both pedestrians and cars cars turning right from 17th onto potomac do not slow down and to do not stop before turning right on red even when pedestrians are present constant speeding on this stretch of kennedy street nw a stop sign at 1st st nw and kennedy street nw could help curb this behavior vehicular traffic going west on kennedy street nw have a terrible intersection at missourikansas avenues to merge into cars frequently speeding down missouri ave and weaving in and out of traffic lanes make this a very dangerous spot left turns are not allowed at this intersection in rush hour which is never enforced and frequently ignored this creates multiple problems including blocking traffic failure to yield to pedestrian or driver and running red lights cars turning off kennedy street nw do not have sufficient time to make turn traffic can back up as many as 2 full blocks due to the short light cycle condition of road between reno and connecticut is dangerous to cycling eastbound downhill on this important cycling connector many cyclists do not yield to pedestrians and ignore the stop signs when there are cars or pedestrians present the people picking up their children from chantelles child care center frequently block the bike line i particularly notice it in the evening between 530 and 630 constant blocking the box and car backups that impede the 80 bus making this turn turn angle on mbt is too sharp bend needs to be softened and more visible esp with cyclists and pedestrians entering fromto r street no 4 way stop this intersection should have a 4 way stop fast moving cars use 8th st as cut through do not stop at stop sign altogether or pull into cross walk a no right turn on red here might help except for the fact that they are never enforced and drivers just ignore them cars stop in the crosswalk across delaware ave if at all and often do not even look right for pedestrians before turning right bad angle prevents drivers from seeing bikes please close this unsafe angle cars often double parked in this block almost constantly on sb side but frequently on both sides damaged bricks from cars parking on the sidewalk double parking is almost constant in this block combined with the lack of lane markings it is a dangerous place to be a cyclist there are constantly people parking in the 3rd lane in the mornings when the lane is no parkingno stopping please have police enforce this law h is very busy in the mornings and cutting down from 3 to 2 lanes because causes major backups cars coming eb on maryland ave turning right onto independence ave often treat the yield sign here as a license to ignore pedestrians crossing in the crosswalk they usually do not even look and only stop in the crosswalk for oncoming cars cars traveling eastbound on kennedy st nw are not permitted to go through missourikansas ave intersection easily cars have to turn down an offshoot of missouri or turn at 2nd st nw it would be easier to make kennedy st nw one continuous corridor construction at 4th and e st sw has continually blocked the bike lane for months without providing safe and separate passage for bikes as is required by dc law multiple construction vehicles and equipment are seen every day parked in the bike lane the missourikansas avenue intersection is a pedestrian cyclist and vehicular nightmare if the medians were removed and kennedy street was continuous many accidents and nearmisses could be avoided the plastic bollards do not continue all the way to the intersection so cars are constantly pulling into the bike lane when trying to park in the angled spaces at the end of the row a white van has almost hit me numerous times red light running is rampant at this intersection even when pedestrians are waiting to cross because of speed along irving street and poor visibility cars have to edge into traffic to see if they can turn left a mirror or stop sign would help although because of irving street classification additional stop signs may not be warranted it is very difficult to cross this intersection on foot as the waiting time is far too long and there often is not a walk signal when the light does cycle through there are numerous issues with this intersectionjaywalkingcars turning right on red bikes running red lights and lack of enforcement drivers routinely drive through the light here sometimes they come to a stop in the crosswalk blocking it but many times they speed right through this bike lane is filled with gravel and other debris and for some reason pedestrians like to use it to walk north cross traffic frequently blocks the box at this intersection making it difficult for cyclists to proceed through the intersection in the cycletrack secret service has been preventing cyclists from passing through the retractable bollards by using police tape this forces us to use the sidewalks to pass through the plaza at this point would be really great if the bikes lanes on kansas would continue southwest of georgia ave cars heading south on 16th and turning right onto new hampshire do not yield to pedestrians crossing at the unsignalized crosswalk across new hampshire please move the vendors and tour buses and extend the cycletrack to constitution ave a direct route is needed between the mayfair neighborhood and benning road so cyclists are not forced to go through the dangerous intersection of benning and minnesota or to travel on minnesota avenue at all cars that fail to queue in the correct lane heading east on florida avenue to eastbound new york avenue cut off drivers who have the right of way to continue on to florida ave vehicles never stop at this crosswalk im sure some of it has to do with the construction i often stop while on bike but the cars just keep flying by wharf construction has eliminated safe biking options separated maintained bike detour necessary for duration of construction cyclists routinely ride against oneway westbound traffic here creating a dangerous situation with no traffic light at exit onto florida ave nw may god have mercy on your soul if you need to bike this way there is no safe path traffic light from phelps place has an extremely long wait for an extremely short light many cyclists routinely run this light after growing impatient to make a left turn onto florida ave nw riders often ride against the oneway traffic biking northbound in a southbound oneway zone creating a hazard for all road users no bike lane or sharrow is present the bike lane has a huge hole and a bunch of gravel right at the entrance off of florida ave which forces bikes into oncoming traffic more giant potholes in this bike lane all up and down i street cars also constantly cross over the double yellow lines into the bike lane to avoid cars parked on i street its very unsafe for bikers cyclists ride against the oneway southbound traffic flow endangering other road users there is no bike lane or sharrow in place road users turning off of 22nd street onto florida ave southbound have very poor sight lines making merging onto florida a very risky proposition cars heading south on 16th street do not yield to pedestrians when turning right on red onto florida they are usually speeding and do not need to slow down to make the overly wide turn the road configuration allows the path to the bikepedestrian part of 14th st bridge needs improvement the sign pole in the middle of the path should be moved the path should be widened and a guard rail should be placed next to the dropoff this intersection is unsafe for pedestrians and bicyclists motorists hardly ever adhere to the yield to pedestrians sign as they come through the light on 21st and pennsylvania a yield sign is not sufficient for this intersection please complete the mbt asap so no one has to ride up the big stinky or use the terrible alternate route any longer cars heading west on new york often make a u turn at 14th street endangering pedestrians who are waiting in the median to cross drivers making a left from arkansas onto piney branch routinely do not check for pedestrians crossing piney branch before turning often at full speed the intersection would benefit from a buttontriggered pedestriancrossingonly light phase there is not sufficient time to cross this intersection and there are lots of children who cross here and it takes them a little longer cars on k street run red lights regularly and given how wide 14th street is here pedestrians are often already in the crosswalk when the cars pass bikers need a dedicated space on this road that is outside of the car door zone given the hills bikers can get moving pretty quickly but they are in the door zone for all the parked cars when the road is closed to through traffic the speed limit needs to be lowered to 10 mph cars travelling 25 mph on this road when it is full of bikers and peds are a real hazard the way the ped signal is timed on the east side of 6th street its almost impossible to get all the way across penn ave with kids then youre stuck in the median with kids who could easily run off cars and bikes dont know how they are supposed to share the road here when heading south up the hill given that bikers generally are heading straight and so should be in the left lane but they are inclined to stay right this road is harrowing for bikers because drivers try to pass even with very limited visibility the biggest danger to cyclists is a headon collision right in front of them due to this unsafe behavior many drivers either dont notice or disregard the midblock traffic light on 18th street between k and l also the road surface here is an embarrassment for any civilization that considers itself advanced on this steep hill i generally bike at least 25 mph but cars still attempt to pass at fast speed developer blocks sidewalk on the south side of v street and no longer provides a protected pedestrian path no signage on the entire block either so peds are forced to cross midblock to the north side or walk in the road bad squeeze from fourlane divided road to twolane road with littleno shoulder after the dcmd line perhaps work with moco to resolve this also for inbound traffic a bad pavement seam at the dc line is dangerous for cyclists crashes possible this stretch of trail is deteriorating badly and needs massive repairs and substantial safety improvements bridge bikewalk pathway is extremely narrow and unsafe also frequently strewn with broken glass 49th street nw has a very short crossing at mass ave nw 12 seconds on average this makes it difficult for all traffic autos bicycles pedestrians to cross diagonal street bias makes the walk akin to 5 or 6 lanes across cars turning left onto maine ave routinely ignore the fact that pedestriansbikes also have the light to cross maine at that time i have had drivers threaten me for getting in their way not enough time for pedestrians to wait for traffic to clear bikes forced to ride on sidewalk coming from 14th street bridge to waterfront area cyclists often ride against the oneway northbound traffic on this street to access connecticut ave business district andor r street bike lane drivers do not expect this behavior cyclists often ride against the oneway eastbound traffic creating a hazardous situation for all road users cars coming from both sides of 17th st nw sometimes do not stop when the light is red some cars drive through although pedestrians have right of way andor already at the middle of the crosswalk driveway to hillyer court has poor sight lines to florida ave nw this has drivers frequently cutting off pedestrians on the sidewalk and cyclists on the road every sunday the bike lane disappears and if you parked here on friday and forgot you cant drive on sunday i have done several surveys and the majority of license plates are from maryland valets at restaurant nora often block travel lane in posted no parking zone to load and unload cars creating bottlenecks and dangerous mixing of cars bicycles and pedestrians crossing florida ave at r street a lot of traffic particularly from of cars on 17th st nw heading toward constitution avenue blocking crosswalk when pedestrians have right of way cars blocking crosswalk plow through too many traffic lights traffic circles by design should not have traffic lights in order to maintain traffic flow and control these lights are poorly timed often placing road users in danger cars coming eb off the h st bridge are often speeding in the past there has some limited enforcement with a speed camera but not in the past couple years since streetcar other construction here please bring it back pick your problem cars parked in the center lane create poor visibility for pedestrians crossing 4th street cars park in bike lanes along the construction area cars doublepark impacting bike lanes and visibility cars make uturns at crosswalk sidewalk on south side of this block has been closed due to construction for a long time the exterior construction is done can anything be done to force them to reopen the sidewalk sooner rather than later cars routinely make u turns along 14th st and dont look for bikers when they pull over to get the widest arch nor when they cut into the bike lane on the other side and have to do a 3 point turn cars routinely ignore this stop sign a camera would catch some of the worst violators theres no crosswalk here between the busstop and the new path that enters into the housing development one needs to be installed as there is sufficient foot traffic no sidewalks on this busy stretch of tilden the northbound cars stop because they have a stop sign but the southbound cars tend to blow through the yield for peds sign when peds are present pretty much all the unsignaled crosswalks along reno have this problem on busy days this narrow sidewalkpath gets very crowded and is inches from traffic drivers turning left often block the l st cycletrack during rush hour forcing bikes into traffic or onto sidewalk north and south 2nd street stop sign are ignored by most crosswalks on 2nd street not labeled expansion joints on bridge both ways have sharp deep edges that are a hazard to cyclists they could cause pinch flats leading to a loss of control and crash for the cyclist eastwest traffic on p street both drivers and cyclists frequently run these stop signs endangering pedestrians cyclists and drivers drivers and cyclists in all directions frequently run this stop sign eastbound traffic tends to run the sign during rush hours southbound in midday times pedestrians bicyclists drivers all adversely affected frequent blocking of the 15th street cycle track due to special church services weddings and funerals issued parking permits interpreted to allow curbside parking thus blocking bike lane dangerous a crosswalksignal to cross maine ave is needed to safely connect two stretches of sidewalk used by people walking to the fish marketwharf the safest course now is to cross 12th st walk on the other side until 9th st cross back then backtrack taxis and cars seeking to drive into the hotel block the right lane making life difficult for bus drivers and cyclists motorists use the busbike lane with no repurcussions this unsignaled crosswalk is often ignored by drivers temporary crossing signal across 4th st nw on north side of massachussetts ave during construction is set incorrectly so it only allows crossing when mass ave has green signal but not when h st does even though it is safe for pedestrians then unsignaled crosswalk ignored by drivers cars making u turns endanger bikers in both directions there is no way for them to signal for this and for bikers to anticipate a u turn safely difficult to get onto pennsylvania ave from the trail here as a cyclist because of awkward bottlenecked curb cut that veers left trail is also very narrow and shared with peds people cross on the left turn signal people double park and block the bike lanes narrow winding bike path very close to busy traffic under the bridge here outbound drivers from montana onto ny ave outbound usually block the box mostly during pm rush hours unnecessarily long red light very little pedestrian traffic tofrom howard and tofrom mcmillan bike lane awkwardly ends on the wrong side of street cyclists have little choices at end of bike lane construction workers and school parking often block this crosswalk and right turn lane onto mount olivet rd ne from 9th st ne this isnt a comfortable crossing at any time of day drivers ignore crosswalk motorists exiting logan circle south to 13th street often run the red light at o st at very high speed i nearly get hit a few times each month i occasionally see motorists driving the wrong way down m st at night between connecticut and 17th st drivers headed west on mass and turning north on wisconsin frequently fail to stop for pedestrians at marked crosswalk crossing wisconsin along the north side of mass cars come very quickly and often see pedestrians waiting yet continue the pedestrian island was removed last year and this intersection is now unbelievably dangerous for pedestrians cars turning left from m to 21st fail to stop for pedestrians no clearly marked left turn lane just a very wide single lane means cars in parallel to one another often both try the left turn at the same time lights on both sides of the intersection make it impossible to cross pennsylvania on one cycle the walk sign is not long enough to cross before drivers get the green arrow to turn right from massachusetts onto 9th street northbound motorists on vermont turning right on o usually cut the corner over the bike lane very dangerous could benefit from flexposts being installed at the turn to protect cyclists motorists harass and honk 5sec sustained at cyclists regularly on this block even when there is a red light ahead police enforcement is needed to protect cyclists when turning right motorists cut across bike lane without looking forcing cyclists into the bollards drivers will often cut from traveling ne on new york ave to traveling e on l street at high rates of speed without yielding to pedestrians crossing 5th street along new york the walk sign crossing 5th street from l street should be automatic pedestrians should not need to press the button there is also a long wait to cross can pedestrians cross 5th at l when the light is green for ny ave traffic too there should be a crosswalk here as many people cross and there is poor visibility due to parked cars sometimes walking down l to cross at 5th is not an option for pedestrian safety reasons construction rowdy behavior at park on corner the construction fencing makes it worse but drivers turning from 7th onto k rarely stop for pedestrians crossing k unclear if the pedestrian signal to cross h street ever appears so lots of jaywalking its very difficult for cyclists to safely turn left from m st onto the key bridge the configuration makes it hard to merge from the right hand lane into the turning lane and it feels unsafe waiting during a red light walkways on the key bridge are not wide enough to comfortably accommodate both cyclists and pedestrians the pedestals for lights jutting into the walkway dont help there should be slow or yield sign for drivers turning right onto the ramp to enter the whitehurst freeway as they are crossing a busy bikeped corridor its very difficult for a cyclists to comfortably cross this intersection either to turn left from florida onto connecticut or to continue straight on florida the right turn slip lane for cars is a big part of it cars turning left onto 17th from new hampshire consistently do not see pedestrians crossing 17th this needs a left arrow to avoid the possibility of a car hitting a ped just like at 16th and u and nh the northfacing street light on the sw corner of 4th and e is out due to construction on that lot this means you have to see the light on the southeast corner to know what the signal is this confuses vehicles that either stop or go randomly no crosswalk from ingomar across 41st street dangerous speeding on this block needs striped crosswalk and signage for uncontrolled intersection at 16th and swann speeding on downhill north due to lack of stop signs or crosswalks no bike lane or dedicated sidewalks for cyclists on nebraska when will ddot finally install the planned bike lanes on woodley it has been 3 years drivers on wisconsin ave frequently run this midblock light at the alley to whole foods parking lot please extend the cycle track all the way to hains point the stretch of road on 15th from where the track ends to maine is frightening on the bike during rush hour which is why you see so many cyclists on the sidewalk even though it is forbidden no sidewalk no place to walk cars routinely block the pedestrian crossing and park in front of the curb where pedestrians enter the crossing cars also use the pedestrian crossing path to perform uturns on to westbound maine ave needs much clearer lines and signage buses park on crosswalk every day when coming to pick updrop kids so people have to walk in between buses visibility is completely reduced for cars coming form nort or south making itvery risky to cross street dead end sidewalks difficult to walk no sidewalk dangerous to walk on most os camden st i cross this street every morning and often drivers heading north on 6th do not stop at the stop sign thanks for the effort the crosswalks here are timed against pedestrians with over a minute wait to cross then only a 15 second window for pedestrians while there is a stop sign on southbound 21st street at the pedestrian cross walk at the school there is not one for northbound traffic veering left off of oklahoma could we at least have a pedestrian crossing sign crosswalk with no signal on wisconsin and chesapeake is dangerous for pedestrians due to speeding poor visibility due to vehicles in other lanes failure of vehicles to yield drivers on piney branch frequently run the light drivers on butternut frequently make turns without looking for pedestrians i think this intersection needs a red light camera the traffic light does not change for cyclists i have waited more than 5 minutes at this intersection a couple of times early morning before 7am and i can not spot any sensors while lights in other intersections do change in all the intersections in this area drivers run red lights frequently as a matter of fact all over dc drivers seem to think that a yellow light means accelerate they end up running red lights or blocking streets as a consequence motorist attempted unsafe pass resident on block this is a thru street with a long stretch without a speed bump car speeds are often excessive and dangerous for pedestrians and children request speed bump dead end sidewalk on one side no sidewalk on the other side cant walk safely to bus stops on branch ave cyclists constantly use the sidewalk up and down 14th instead of the bike lanes no sidewalk on all all of park dr no way to walk safely there is a tree just outside of 1909 constitution ave ne between the sidewalk and road that is 45 dead a large branch fell off and is now in the road the rest of the tree appears to be likely to fall down soon two jaywalking issues 1 ingleside employees jaywalk from e4 buses across military 2 wilson and deal students transferring from e4 buses to m4 buses jaywalk across 30th place cars frequently run the red light turning onto whitehaven people routinely park along the sidewalk bulb out making it difficult for 2 lanes of traffic to pass ive even seen someone get sideswiped here one time because they were parked poorly the crosswalk on the west side of this intersection has only ten seconds to cross a relatively wide stretch of c street this is a fraction of the 20 seconds available to pedestrians on the east side of the intersection while there are crosswalks there are no stop signs this is confusing to pedestrians and drivers alike as they subconsciously assume that e street traffic will stop at 23rd place entrance to alley and all of the wylie st alley streets are crumbling pot holes continue to show up and city and work vehicles are main contributors to this you can not drive or walk safely due to the condition of the streets they must be repaired streets on wylie st east of 13th street are in really bad shape i tripped and fell and there is gravel everywhere cars on 6th st nw are usually backed up and will run the light to cross ny ave nw when crossing 6th st as a pedestrian cars trying to make a left turn from ny ave nw have difficulty spotting pedestrians who are crossing 6th many people cross diagonally here cars from ny ave nw have difficulty spotting pedestrians due to many improperly parked vehicles that reduce visibility of sidewalks and people the redlight at windom and conn heading northbound on conn is hard to see causing drivers to run the redlight pedestrian signal timers are routinely hit by trucks turning from ny ave nw onto 1st st nw timers have always been hit and turned askew therefore not visible to pedestrians submitted multiple 311 tickets they get fixed and routinely hit again too long of a wait for pedestrians to cross ny ave also very dangerous with cars running red lights to avoid waiting longer to get onto 395 drivers frequently speed when approaching right turn onto franklin st ne often not seeing pedestrians til the last minute due to a big tree blinding the pedestrian crossing and speeding should be a fourway stop difficult sight lights for drivers on legation attempting to cross 31st street there have been multiple accidents in the past pedestrian signal installed upside down motorists exiting office building make illegal left turn up oneway street to use the buildings back alley as a shortcut to northbound 3rd street se the maneuver cuts off pedestrians and a bike lane and potentially southbound motorists cars regularly park in the northbound new hampshire ave bike lane just before the intersection the line defining the parking line is rounded so drivers think if they are partially within that rounded space theyre ok cars regularly park in the eastbound t street bike lane just before the intersection the line defining the parking line is rounded so drivers think if they are partially within that rounded space theyre ok confusing some 19th st vehicles stop even though they dont have a stop sign some t st vehicles pedestrians assume 4way stop and cross in front of 19th st vehicles also poor visibility southward for eastbound pedestrians due to parked cars confusing intersection because westbound florida light stays green 15 seconds longer than eastbound florida light pedestrians see one red light and start to cross not clear how it helps traffic flow to have mismatched signal timing very difficult to cross irving walking west on michigan because bushes block the view of westbound michigan vehicles guard railing around metro chiller plant behind woodson row 19161922 12th street nw restricts access to alley making it nearly impossible to enter alley from northern entrance guard railing needs to be shiftedshortened on northern end on ramps onto and off 295 from penn ave all directions there is no stopping for pedestrians cyclist crossing sousa bridge ddot could start by restriping crosswalks then some enforcement by mpd alabama ave se at all marked intersections between 30th st and branch ave cars do not stop for pedestrians need flashing lights and enforcement there is a lot of people crossing in the middle of the block and using the bike lanes as a hang out while waiting for traffic to clear many drivers run the red light in the slip lane from k street to connecticut northbound by treating it like a right on red this is a very unsafe situation given all of the pedestrians coming from the farragut metro exit at this corner drivers regularly run the red turn arrow from 18th onto l street right lane should be straight only at this light and left lane should be for all left turns cars turning left from both lanes frequently conflict over which lane theyre turning into cars rushing to make the green light at 11th frequently fail to yield to pedestrians all of these crosswalks should be protected with stop signs several could also use revised parking for better sight lines the turn signals from m st onto 4th st are in an unusual cycle and are hard to see by pedestrians pedestrians see the do no walk sign but see the light is red and attempt to cross not realizing the cars have a green turn arrow some drivers take this turn far too quickly some drivers treat 39th between rodman and massachusetts as a speedway some drivers take this turn too quickly cars often speed through this intersection without stopping stop signs need to be more visible during pm rush hour there are many cars here that run the red andor block the box leading to dangerous situations in which pedestrians have a walk sign but cars are still trying to muscle through the crosswalk motorists discharge their passengers into the busy cycle track or even sometimes park in the cycletrack they get aggressive and confrontational when cyclists try to get by drivers especially delivery truck drivers park in or too close to the crosswalk this is dangerous because it hinders the ability of street users to see each other motor vehicles fail to yield to pedestrians and use excessive speed as potomac avenue turns into oneway after 18th street signage on this portion of the intersection western crosswalk near e street are posted too high for motorists to notice m street buffered bike lane should be completed as originally intended providing protected lane as on other portions of m st motorists often turn into parking structure without yielding to or seeing bike traffic in buffered bike lane poor visibility due to parked carsconsider removing one on street parking space at this garage entry point there needs to be a crosswalk here there is a bus stop that lets off on the river park side but the closest crosswalks are at canal or 4th street a crosswalk is needed to allow people to get to the community center more easily military road is missing a sidewalk for much of the distance across the park vehicles particularly city busses speed through here constantly it is a sharp turn and many people jaywalk fromt he bustop across the street both a crosswalk and speed bumps are needed here cars turning right do not yield to bicyclists ive nearly been hit several times the sidewalk here is torn up from trees it is impossible to get by via wheelchair and very difficult to for two pedestrians to pass abreast pedestrians have a cross signal at the same time that cars have a green light to turn left from m st onto south capitol they often do not yield to pedestrians and are probably going too fast to see and yield drivers often do not have enough room to get over to turn right onto 7th st from q and consequently often block the bike lane furthermore drivers do not signal here i myself have crashed into a cars fender here because of this with virginia avenue closed here why not have the signals flashing yellow for fourth street there areno turns so no need to stop northsouth traffic thanks this is a very confusingunsafe intersection for vehicles many vehicular crashes occur due to driver confusion poor sightlines and poor design this intersection needs a major redesign in coordination with md cars continuing on u st east from florida ave often do not stop at the red light continuing through when the very short 15 second pedestrian light is on to cross u st there needs to be a crosswalk here bikes cross this ramp to get to the sidewalk before crossing again after the bridge to get onto anacostia tral there needs to be a crosswalk and lights to alert drivers the light at the roundabout here doesnt recognize bikes they constantly have to run the red unless a car is also waiting to go straight this section of rhode island ave is riddled with potholes so cyclists are often forced to go into the middle lane of traffic which is extremely dangerous street vendor often illegally parks in left turn lane during morning and evening rush hour periods blocks both the turn lane and bottlenecks the bike lane cars and trucks often turn right onto 20th street from the the middle lane not the righthand turn lane often cutting off cyclists and forcing them to either slam on the brakes or swerve onto the sidewalk to avoid hitting them cars often drive way too fast down this section of new jersey ave in both directions i witnessed a cyclist get hit by a car here after the car was speeding to go through a red light and the signal already turned green for traffic going east on q peds crossing ct ave 18th st nw is a disaster drivers run the red lights and block the crosswalks forcing pedestrians into the traffic lanes there also simply isnt enough time on the crosswalk countdown to cross 6 lanes of traffic why cant northbound traffic from maine onto 12th have a permanent green light theres no other traffic turning onto 12th here just give those turning left to continue on maine red and green arrows thanks for considering this should be signed as noright turn on red with the new sidewalk closure around the o street market and accompanying advertising signage both pedestrians and drivers have difficulty seeing the northbound and westbound oncoming traffic at the corner of 9th p often drivers pull up and through the bike box here both in the left and right hand lane there isnt enough time for older people or seniors to cross here there needs to be a crosswalk around the k street intersection a lot of vehicles will stop and park along the e street bike lane as defined by dcmr 1899 crosswalks exist on all sides of an intersection and peds have right of way at all crosswalks but ddot has posted signs here allowing people to park in the unmarked crosswalks on both sides of this intersection this whole stretch of 11th from florida to s st is awful for bikers and cars cars dont want to share the sharrowed lane with bikers and pass very dangerously to get around them the road is also very torn up drivers routinely fail to stop and give right of way to pedestrians at this crosswalk the last big storm blew down the convex safety mirror hung opposite this alley cars coming out of this alley now can not see other cars bikes and peds please reinstall a new safety mirror opposite this alley on 13th between fairmont and girard taxis and uber drivers block the crosswalk to drop off passengers here the walk signal for the west crosswalk is only 4 seconds this is not enough time for the crowds at this point to get off the curb as peds are required to do by dc code 50220128 and dcmr 1823 there needs to be a 4 way stop here traffic on girard has a stop but 11th doesnt drivers on girard either assume 11th street has stop signs or dangerously try to go through the intersection instead of waiting for a break in traffic buses and other motor vehicles often begin left turn onto 7th street from eastbound penn ave when left turn signal is red posing hazard to those crossing on northern intersection of 7th penn ave why was this bike lane taken away now it goes from bike lane to sharrow to bike lane in less than a block cars dont give bikes room after crossing massachusetts and stay in the bike lane instead of transitioning properly from sharrow to bike lane drivers routinely fail to stop and give right of way to pedestrians here there are constantly cars parked in the bike lanes on 4th st sw between m st and i st they need to be ticketed and forced to move when biking through here their illegal behavior often forces me to cut into traffic to avoid hitting them motorists often enter right turn lane without yielding to bike traffic in mixing zone more adequate signage should remind drivers to yield to bike traffic before entering the turn lane ddots engineers have inappropriately taken walk time from pedestrians crossing the nw and se corners of wisconsin and tenley and given it to drivers trying to turn compare the timing on these corners to the timing on the ne and sw corners few people can cross all of penn ave in 17 seconds i walk fast and even i have to book it drivers heading north on wisconsin wanting to turn left onto macomb have a choice of being hit by cars coming southbound on wisconsin or running over pedestrians in the macomb crosswalk cars need a leftturn arrow there bus idling is common along maine ave and dcs antiidling law is not being enforced bus idling is endemic at union stations 2nd floor dcs antiidling law is not being enforced despite numerous signs bus drivers do not comply will be argumentative when asked to stop idling a bus and calls to mpd for enforcement are ignored the light to cross ny ave along 5th st only allows 18 seconds for pedestrians this is not long enough for handicapped pedestrians or the elderly motorists do not check for pedestrian foot traffic before pulling into or out of the garage entrance on the east side of 20th st on this block awkward intersection and speeding vehicles turning onto e street from westbound potomac avenue cause hazard for pedestrians in crosswalk needed extended curbs to force more perpendicular entry ontoout of e st stop for pedestrians flexipost signage needed at both crosswalks on potomac avenue at this intersection motorists rarely stop and use excessive speed several collisions here when motorists attempt to pass other vehicles that are turning north onto 18th street high speeds and impatience a problem at this intersection where potomac avenue turns to oneway riding a bike on constitution is a death wish due to the speeding cars motorists southbound on 18th street often turn without stopping causing hazards for pedestrians at this intersection and further down at potomac avenue and e street crosswalks problem oneway portion of potomac avenue encourages this behavior a crosswalk is needed here pedestrians realize that they cant get to the other side without going all the way to virginia so they just jaywalk this is 45 mph cars regularly pass me going at least 65 almost impossible to cross this street speeding a lot of speeding cars speed here and pass dangerously it is unnecessary to have two lanes for cars along this stretch there should be a bike only lane and a car only lane many pedestrians crossing willynilly like all along this block speeding cars do not stop for pedestrians this light and the pedestrian cross button do not work i once saw workers adjusting the lights i told them this and they said theyd fix it they didnt cars speed across the bridge lots of people jaywalk here and all down benning road at this light in particular i nearly hit people while having the green light all the time drivers heading north on wisconsin wanting to turn left onto macomb get stuck halfway into the left turn forcing them to choose between being head by southbound cars or running over pedestrians in the macomb crosswalk very dangerous cars routinely speed along this section of wisconsin which is heavily trafficked by pedestrians cars routinely speed on this section of wisconsin in front of the cathedral which is heavily trafficked by pedestrians the bike lanes on 5th st nw north of here need to connect to bike lanes on 7th st nw to the southwest this is a small but important gap in the network the bike lane is consistently blocked by trucks drivers drive aggressively and noone does anything about it there is a large bump across the road due to an underground pipe but it is not marked someone even spraypainted to mark it but it faded it is great to slow people down but mean to hide the method of doing so paint this unintentional speed hump there is literally no reason for this street to exist other than to store cars deadending it in the middle would prevent dangerous cut through traffic constant standing around from pedestrians and cars loitering pedestrians are constantly in the street and are a hazard to both bikes and cars cars including mpd vehicles wo emergency lights always run through this stop sign without stopping dangerous with families around perhaps a raised crosswalk andor speed hump on 6th btwn va ave and g st would help slowstop traffic crossing wisconsin at woodley the crosswalk light is about 15 seconds long impossible to get across in the allotted time because 2 lanes shift left through the intersection and then merge shortly after crossing mass ave vehicles in the left lane often cross into the right lane without warning cars often run the no turn on left signal and drive into the cycle track aggressive speeding no enforecement red lights are run almost every cycle poor sight lines due to close and illegally parked cars make this tough for drivers also drivers just dont stop this area is heavily trafficked and as a result difficult to bike through with parking banned on one side of the street adding bike lanes or a cycle track would be relatively easy aggressive speeding every day drivers turning north from 3rd st can not see cars headed north on blair rd and many near misses occur plus signals dont give many gaps in traffic cars including police cars and buses frequently run this stop sign due to the hill right turning cars often fail to stop for pedestrians everyone fails to stop for pedestrians right turning cars often fail to see pedestrians the paint lines are faded which create overly wide traffic lanes encouraging speeding repainting would made this intersection much safer drivers often speed and dont have time to notice me the exitentrance to the parking has a large blind spot to the north adding a stop sign for all cars would make this access point much safer this portion of montana ave has poor sidewalks and visibility tree brush is constantly lying in the sidewalk along with trash additionally there is a light post in the middle of the sidewalk biking on military ave between conn ave and western ave is like biking on the moon sooooo many craters this road is crumbling and driving never mind biking is a nightmare pave the road cars are always double parked blocking bike lane andor parked in the center median including mpd dcfc and other city vehicles dangerous for bikers to merge inout of traffic and for pedestrian visibility when crossing street no sidewalk or crosswalk and drivers often make the turn to portal drive at higher speed very short sidewalk on the northwest side of intersection midblock crosswalk motorists rarely stop or yield for pedestrians sidewalk on south side of i street closed for constructions pedestrians forced to cross the 15th street cycletrack should be extended at least as far as the mall likely much further also the kind folks who own the ellipse love to randomly block entrances and exits blocking one of the routes for people heading to the national mall many cyclists and segway riders fail to stop for the red light and fail to give right of way to pedestrians at the signals along here especially at g and f streets bricks missing from sidewalk andor sunken into ground cars turning onto 9th from rhode island frequently fail to yield to pedestrians it is very very dangerous to cross the street there cars frequently speed down 2nd street and fail to yield to pedestrians especially at the crosswalk at t st cars frequently speed down 2nd street which creates safety issues for pedestrians cyclists run this light constantly its because in the morning when the light at fifth street turns green the light at 4th st turns red so cars and bikes have to wait at two consecutive lights ive seen a number of close calls here trucks often double park right at the ne corner of 22nd i streets primarily serving gws medical faculty associates crossing the gw parkway shouldnt be done atgrade or if it must drivers should be made to stop with a stoplight or other traffic control device it is a major safety hazard pedestrians crossing 18th street at n have a 6 second walk signal followed by 92 seconds of waiting for another walk signal to come around drivers trying to turn right onto n obstruct the crosswalk during and after the very short ped walk signal the sidewalk on the south side of north portal drive is not up to code there are utility poles in the middle of the sidewalk interfering brush and no curb cuts this is on nps land but needs to be brought up to current standards the light doesnt provide quite enough time to cross unless you walk very quickly its difficult for younger or older pedestrians to make it across in time very dangerous virginia drivers trying to get home coming through alley visibility to turn either way onto cathedral ave is impossible due to cars parked on cathedral ave close to alley until you pull out far enough to block trafficbe hit residents along the south side of the street store trash and recycling bins on the sidewalk all the time this blocks the sidewalk no pedestrian crosswalk across d st on the north side of this intersection multilane marked crosswalks up and down 15th need to be enhanced speeders and aggressive drivers change lanes to fly past the rare car that stops for pedestrians here crosswalk stings and speed tables would be nice posted speed limit is 15mph on mall drives but i am constantly tailgated or passed dangerously by drivers even though i ride 1520mph these speeders disregard the tourists school groups and summer camp kids walking around the mall sb shadows should be placed on the left side of the right lane to set cyclists up for the short bike lane current location encourages cyclists to ride in a righthook position frequent jaywalking across wisconsin ave please ticket extremely poor road surface potholes uneven paving creates great hazards cars turning right from western age onto wisconsin age northbound often do not yield to pedestrians in crosswalk cars make a right turn going north and do not stop for pedestrians already engaged with the pedestrian green light cars make a right turn on red without stoppingchecking for pedestrians crossing with the pedestrian green light have almost gotten run over a number of times while in the middle of the pedestrian path on a pedestrian green light cars make a turn on the plaza road and drive 30 mileshour on that stretch if no speed limit sign is put up there its only a matter of time before a kid playing on the plaza residents of leo or safeway shoppers get run over traveling northbound on 10th street the two way street suddenly becomes one way at ny ave without any obvious place for people on bikes to take refuge from oncoming cars its better to cut across the city centre plaza to avoid the intersection double parking zoo creates traffic freeforall especially cars crossing double yellow to navigate through these buildings have loading docks thats where deliveries should be made 20 years experience biking in dc and nj ave from ny ave to florida is one of the worst sections for speeding and aggressive lane changes 40 mph cars not unusual making turn from south cap bike lane to eastbound bike trail to poplar point too tight of a radius steep dangerous to inexperienced cyclists needs redesign city employees routinely double park or park poorly blocking the right lane of west bound u street light timing afternoon rush hour southbound ct ave traffic is held while northbound ct traffic turns onto west bound calvert long after any traffic remains andor light at 24th street backs up traffic parked cars on spring near the intersection cause the roadway to be so narrow that often cars can not pass through which blocks the crosswalk on spring the roadway is blocked by parked cars that obstruct traffic and so everything gets stuck in the crosswalk and pedestrians have to slide in between cars to cross spring for pedestrians on 7th trying to cross massachusetts there is neither a pedestrian signal nor a traffic signal visible cars are always double parked in the bike lane in front of this apartment building i have never been able to ride in this lane without it being obstructed by cares the construction site keeps leaving unmarked and unpaved metal plates in the bike lane traffic tofrom the parkway think that they are still on it needs a couple speed humps like the adjoining blocks cars run this red light all the time especially going straight across blaire a red light camera would make this intersection safer excessive speeding and redlight running in the area zero enforcement from any law enforcement agency the bikelane on the north side of i street is permanently blocked by idling cars picking up or dropping people off at the apartment buildings cars often make a left on the red signal from 15th onto s st bicyclists routinely run the red light when cars on 15th want to turn left onto u street i recommend installing a bicycle traffic light on this intersection as many bicyclists dont know the pedestrian signal is their traffic light some do tho pm rush hour cars routinely block the crosswalk and even the entire intersection going north on 15th this makes it difficult for cars to cross harvard bikes to go anywhere and pedestrians to cross it is incredibly hard to turn left onto 15th from harvard and not bicycle on the sidewalk due to the lack of space parked cars and no bicycle lane multiple drivers take right turns too quickly andor swerve around stopped metrobuses to make right turns from center lanes pedestrians on 7th have neither a pedestrian signal nor a traffic signal they can see to cross massachusetts there is a traffic light on massachusetts only drivers can see cars for hotel pull into the road or make uturns without looking for safety i always ride in the middle or left side of the lane on this block but still frequently almost hit once a week most dangerous part of my 7 mile commute driver of a motorized bike came from between two cars stopped for a red light at wb benning road the bike was traveling at what seemed like a high rate of speed it didnt even slow down for the red light missing me by a couple of feet many cars ignore marked pedestrian crossing this intersection needs a four way stop sign cars on quincy often do not see pedestrians when trying to cross kansas because they are looking for traffic on kansas tour buses routinely stop here and loadunload tourists are unaware of the bicycle lanes and just hop off the bus right in front of bicyclists it is incredibly dangerous for everyone when the secret service closes pennsylvania ave 17th is a challenging street to bicycle on especially due to the two right turn lanes and the bus stop car drivers frequently run the red left arrow when turning on to 23rd st traveling north or turn right leaving 23rd st traveling south regardless of whether pedestrians are present or whether they have the right of way sections of r street were paved over 3 months ago and the bike lanes have yet to be restriped its a wild west out there as cars approach on e st se towards pa ave they are focused on the merge which is greater than 90 degrees to their left this then creates a blind spot to pedestrians as they cross from the right young trees in tree boxes also add to poor vis as e st merges into pa ave there are two lane options for cars both of which merge into the same lane on pa ave only a single lane is needed for this one way street recommend closing off the right lane which has limited pedestrian visibility this 4way stop is often ignored by cars traveling along 11th st recommend making 4way stop more visible to car drivers perhaps with overhead hanging stop signs across the street this used to be possible to cross now light for pedestrians is way too short 9th street going south is a one way street going north a large number of cars use the virginia avenue access from the west to turn south on 9th and run through the one way sign police officers do this as well drivers exiting i395 are aggressive and do not stop at the light even when pedestrians have the rowright on red is way too dangerous here 14th street traffic speeds and runs this red light constantly no crosswalk on the south side of 37th makes no sense bike lane is way too small and always disrespected by drivers remove a lane of parking add a two way cycle track remove a lane of parking add a bike lane road is 2 lanes each way clearly marked cars accelerate to reach light 2 blocks east at branch ave creating additional hazards neighborhood has many children and families as well as daycare providers and dcdpr community centers nearby fix it this intersection has been a problem for at least a decade we have been reporting accidents here for the last 10 years at the least there needs to be a stop sign cars frequently speed along this stretch of kansas ave as they are trying to make the light at kansas and 13th street this intersection has poor timing upshur auto and foot traffic can not cross ks and ga avenues as the lights are poorly synched upshur ga and ks need their due time to make this a flowin intersection awkward street crossing and lighting many accidentally run red lights here and put pedestrians at risk entire sidewalk along south side of florida is very small dangerous does not have a shoulder for the road and is inaccessible to many only one side is crossable not both sides also a long and unsafefeeling wait many rush to beat red lights here putting pedestrians at risk no stop sign here pedestrians crossing swann on the east side of 17th regularly disregard the walk signal this is particularly hazardous with regard to traffic making a right into eastbound swann from northbound new hampshire reminder plaque for peds needed crosswalk not observed by drivers requires repainting and better signage not obscured by large trees as current signs are i was hit while in crosswalk on 4152015 requiring emergency room care drivers often fail to stop at the twin crossings flanking belmont low visibility exiting from gallaudet due to kipp construction workers and school staff parking on the road right up to the gallaudet entrance making a left turn is difficult due to speeding cars going up north on brentwood parkway abandoned white van left parked on ny ave for a week its parked on the shoulder where the curve runs to the right blindly very dangerous cars from west virginia and montana ave usually run the red light and blocks the ny ave by making right turn into ny east bound past the triangle area it takes too long before the red light will change to let penn st drivers make left turn into ny ave westbound and the green signal is too short which allows only 34 cars at a time drivers frequently fail to stop at this intersectionmostly the ones traveling north and south on 11th street drivers frequently fail to stop at this intersection despite the fourway stop drivers traveling north and south on 11th street often go right through the intersection without stopping cars regularly park in the clifton street crosswalk especially on the southbound side of 14th this makes it dangerous for pedestrians who squeeze inbetween parked cars and dangerous for bicyclistscars who dont see them clearly large delivery trucks routinely double park in the southbound lane of 14th in the morning around 8 am this pushes both cars and bicyclists into 1 lane there is a large 12 hole in the sidewalk instead of fixing the hole it has been covered with large pieces of wood large blocksrocks and cones it poses a safety hazard and is not accessible for a wheelchair anymore not wide enough i have witness 3 nearmisses less than a foot clearance in the past 10 months because cars frequently do not stop for pedestrians in these crosswalks i see at least 23 times a week cars fly by while pedestrians try to cross sidewalks are needed in this neighborhood there are many pedestrians especially so close to the metro and the park because of the long cycle and different phases for northbound and southbound traffic on ontario road pedestrians often cross against the lightand are thus in the intersection when the light turns green for southbound ontario delivery trucks often park on both sides of 21st street during rush hour blocking 2 of three lanes doubleparking is rampant on this block with a combination of street parking parking lot entrances and storemall entrances this block should be a high priority for doubleparking enforcement uncontrolled crosswalk across a 2 lane highway rare to see a car yield to a pedestrian poor visibility because of confusing intersection and hills when walking n or s on 5th st nw to or from the safewayvery common pedestrians have only 20 seconds to cross 7 lanes of traffic 2 on l in front of safeway 4 on ny ave 1 on l on the north side of the street n st nw between 12 and 13th has dangerous bumps and holes although it deters speeding cars it is debilitating for cyclists who often ride on the sidewalk or in oncoming traffic to avoid huge potholes and bumps in the westbound travel lane at the bottom of this exit ramp vehicles frequently blow through the stop sign endangering both pedestrians and bicyclists and vehicles coming down maryland ave poor visibility exiting public alley onto 15th streetdue to the bike lane cars are parked at a higher slope in the road than cars in the alley way block the view of oncoming traffic view of sidewalk and bike lane to north are blocked by wall cars exiting alley on west side of 15th have poor visibility of pedestrians and cyclists coming south on 15th due to a low brick wall obstructing the view and of cars driving north on 15th due to cars parked at a higher elevation due to bike lane cars are running the red light because signal is not visible and driving through the pedestrian crosswalk extremely hazardous additionalbetter traffic signal placement for southbound traffic at the corner of 24th and connecticut is needed this is an awkward light pattern you can go right on red into a green light to continue southeast on fl ave or right on green into an immediate red light cars on park road turning left or right onto georgia ave fail to yield to bikes and often cars going straight on park rd across georgia ave pedestrians walking north on the east side of 18th often begin to cross against the light that is for cars coming from u onto florida or during the part of the light that is for southbound cars on 18th turning left onto u st pedestrians on 7th have no pedestrian signal nor can they see a traffic signal motorists do have a signal on massachusetts that only they can see police cars always double park on this block sometimes in a line of 5 or 6 cars narrowing this twoway street to one lane which is dangerous enough for cars but extremely dangerous for bikers all sharrows on sherman placed dangerously far to the right implying that cyclists should ride in the door zone and that drivers have room to pass safely drivers are often impatientaggressive when cyclists ride safely in the center of the lane dangerous to cross on quincy as a driver pedestrian or cyclist due to poor visibility and kansas ave traffic not having stop sign all similar nearby intersections have 4way stops frequent aggressive driver behavior and unsafe passing of cyclists on p st nwbetween 26th rock creek additional signagesharrows would help no safe eastwest cycling routes exist between the georgetown waterfront and woodley park calvert st nw pedestrians only have 17 seconds to cross 16th street which is not enough time for seniors and people with disabilities it also encourages unsafe pedestrian behavior as people run to catch their bus sidewalk is far too narrow on irving between hiatt and 16th a pedestrian on 7th has neither a pedestrian signal nor can they see the traffic signal drivers have on massachusetts cars traveling on florida avenue ne routinely speed and run red lights at the intersection of 13th and florida avenue ne some cars travel at staggering speeds exceeding 50mph this is a very dangerous intersection for everyone involved a pedestrian crossing massachusetts at 7th has no pedestrian signal or traffic signal visible a pedestrian crossing massachusetts at 7th has no pedestrian signal and can not see traffic signal this street is narrow and scary to bike on but an empty curb lane could easily be converted into a cycle track or bike lanes cars frequently run this light with impunity a pedestrian crossing massachusetts at 7th has no pedestrian signal nor can they see the traffic signal on massachusetts there is no stop sign at this intersection or clearly marked crosswalk and cars turning right from 14th st se on to south carolina ave se do not slow down they are often speeding or stop to look for pedestrians very dangerous drivers make illegal turns and uturns and drive the wrong way on o street drivers turning left from new hampshire onto 21st treat the left as a straight green and blow right through the crosswalk i have almost been hit several times drivers speed on madison dr all the time madison dr has sharrows but drivers still frequently honk and aggressively try to pass cyclists who are legally riding in the street drivers traveling westbound on penn run the red light here all the time either they dont care or think the green line for i street traffic is for them box blocking at this intersection during rush hour is a given city buses and cars constantly run the red light on pennsylvania avenue nw crossing 22nd street nw the intersection is often fully blocked by buses and cars when the light on washington circle is also red there should be a crosswalk here tons of students walking to the quad or the law school cross here when leaving 2000 penn because its more convenient than walking to the end of the block and then backtracking no stop signs for cars traveling on mass ave cars fail to stop for pedestrians likely because they can not see them given the parked cars and angle of mass ave drivers fail to give right of way to pedestrians in the unsignalized marked crosswalks at this intersection primarily drivers traveling across f thru the east and west crosswalks but also drivers turning across the south crosswalk drivers routinely fail to give right of way to pedestrians here drivers fail to stop for pedestrians at the markedunsignalized crosswalks around this circle drivers fail to stop for pedestrians at the marked unsignalized crosswalk cars on florida ave neboth directions run this red light on a regular basis often cars travel at ludicrous speeds exceeding 50mph this is an extremely unsafe and dangerous intersection for pedestrians and drivers entering from 13th st ne bikers frequently do not obey the pedestrian signal at this intersection possibly because the signal is very short due to the leftturn signal for cars it is not uncommon for drivers to turn the wrong way up 17th street bikes frequently go the wrong way in the bike lane on 17th street nw sometimes even go the wrong way up regular traffic lanes cars frequently speed on park place from rock creek church road to kenyon it is dangerous for drivers attempting to turn onto park place and dangerous for those using the bike lanes during rush hour drivers block the box on just about every single light cycle the city could make a fortune if they actually enforced here the sidewalk is raised and needs to be shaved down so that people dont trip drivers illegally standing in crosswalks waiting to pick up people at capitol south sometimes cars with congressional id dumped in crosswalks and a of course never with tickets on them frequent box blocking by drivers at this intersection the bike lanes on 11th street se have been torn up on the east side and need to be repaved so they dont damage bike tires southbound cars on 7th try to get through the pedestrian traffic to make a left the red light there is a sign that says no parking by the campus gate construction workers continue to park daily and i have a hard time checking out the passing traffic before getting on 6th street especially during rush hours the sign needs to be enforced almost got doored here 2 times no clear crosswalk and cars often turn to north portal drive at a high rate of speed sidewalk randomly ends midblock cars turning right on 19th during rush hour often cut off bikers westbound on bike lane when turning right onto spring rd nearly impossible to see around parked cars cars going west dont slow and take full road as it becomes a oneway street halfway dangerous driving either direction on spring road between 13th and 14th streets cars speed through neighborhood en route to turn onto 16th often drivers treat as oneway driving in the middle of the road parking on both sides makes this challenge drivers park in or too close to the east and west crosswalks blocking pedestrians ability to see approaching drivers and vice versa equally problematic old town trolley shuttles use the space between crosswalks to pick up and discharge passngrs many drivers fail to stop and give right of way to pedestrians drivers heading east on rock creek church road will often speed up to make the light this causes speeding on rock creek church road and light running at the light there are a lot of california stops on northbound warder at this intersection north bound cars on warder street tend to drive through this intersection with rolling stops its dangerous for pedestrians the timing on that incerstation on bladenberg at times can be very long and when we finally able to move the lights changes soo fast that we are not able to empty the cars in between cycling of the lights it is extremely difficult when travelling eastbound on taylor to see cars coming southbound on new hampshire cars and buses particularly the h8 speed excessively downhill on rock creek church road cars frequently come to rolling stops or no stops as they travel north on warder this is unsafe for pedestrians cars often speed through this crosswalk while exiting ri ave onto u st ne it is a very dangerous crosswalk for pedestrians as drivers often do no see pedestrians walking northbound on ri ave until they are already in the crosswalk lots of speeding most notably southbound between m and p needs a four way stop sign its dangerous trying to make turns onto 49th st the parked vehicles block the view a lot of running the stop sign at eastern and crittenden intersection massive bumps from michigan ave to fort dr drivers stop to pick up and drop off students dimly lit underpass cars routinely run the stop sign on 17th the stop sign is often very difficult to see because it is blocked by tall delivery vehicles at the safeway it would help a lot to add curb extensions to move the stop signs out closer to the travel lanes theres no stop sign and no speed bumps near this intersection and cars coming speeding off florida up through a residential neighborhood easy fix please please add a second or two of wait time between light changes florida turns green the same second that 6th turns red and it is just begging for a t bone car accident the city should buy this wendys and completely restructure the traffic pattern here it is the most inefficient and dangerous in the city for drivers bikers and pedestrians exiting gallaudets brentwood gate is dangerous because the construction vehicles are blocking the on coming traffic view they are also parked in the right turning lane great deal of speeding on this segment of eastern avenue with cars routinely exceeding posted 25mph speed limit and running stop signs at intersections of 16th st ne and crittenden ne situation made worse by a blind hill in middle of block h st towards n capitol cars will go over into the bus staging lane to speed past waiting traffic to cut back into driving lane ahead of the waiting traffic they have run the light on top of the bridge and nearly hit pedestrians waiting to cross since this is a long block cars routinely go over 40mph to make the next light at warder city buses and large vehicles go so fast that it shakes the foundation of my house many times a day steel plate in road that hasnt been fixed in 2 years routinely get stuck half way through the intersection when crossing westbound because the light to cross georgia ave is only 20 seconds this crossing is both kansas and georgia ave but theres not enough time for both this is a hazardous crosswalks it isnt clear that there is a signal controlling this crosswalk trinidad and montello get used as 40 mph speed ways through the neighborhood i know this is a bus route but a speed bump in this neighborhood full of families would make all the difference the rightmost southbound lane here is blocked for the sake of parking for only a handful of tshirt and hot dog trucks cyclists going from the cycletrack to the mall are forced to split through gridlock traffic or ride on crowded sidewalks 4th street is one way until it hits morse street heading south so oncoming traffic turns off florida into the warehouse district needs to be clearly noted that 4th going north is one way and 4th between morse and fl is 2 way the inner circle of dupont is the lane for turning out of the circle and the outter is the lane for continuing around please explain and i mean that both as in justify this choice and if not changed put down some arrows and up some signs cant see to make turns here because cars can park too close to the intersection drivers make illegal turns onto o street and illegal uturns there needs to be a better bike path along s capital and overlook so that cars and bikes are not competing for the right lane vehicles wmata buses in particular speed down montello st ne through this intersection which has very limited visibility of pedestrians especially on the north side from the top of the hill this should be a threeway stop cars consistently run the yellow and red light coming down l street cars mostly taxis are constantly blocking the left lane here during rush hour while waiting for space and room in the driveway to turn left into the hotel the hotel ramp should be accessible as a right hand turn only cars and uhaul trucks are consistently parked on the north side right hand lane before 930am causing two lanes of cars and bikers to merge dangerously and backing up traffic for blocks down k street ne unlike the rest of k st ne there is no no parking during rush hour sign in front of the new building on the northwest corner of 1st k st nw causing cars and bikes to either merge dangerously or create three lanes drivers going wrong way down oneway street between half st sw and s capitol bike light on sb new hampshire is not long enough to have more than 2 bicyclists lots of wb cars even as this is a one way street street paving is in complete disrepair needs to be repaved pedestrians and joggers jaywalking in 1st st ne cycletrack and not using crosswalks consider fencing to deter jaywalking especially during nightlife hours drivers speeding through and not stopping at crosswalk crosswalk poorly marked and lit cars get into accidents when turning left off of hamilton at least 4 in past year the angle of the road north of the intersection blocks the view of southbound traffic parking sign is too close to intersection and parked cars block the view confusing intersection with cars turning left and right into whole foods with many peds present i saw a police officer reprimand kids on the sidewalk here even though they had the right of way green arrows make cars think they can ignore peds cars travelling southbound on 13th or making left turns from kansas ave to 13th run this light multiple times a day i have nearly been hit twice in the past year while crossing this intersection on foot this block of 13th is at the bottom of two hills and drivers routinely speed down the street a speed camera installed on the southbound lanes hasnt made much of a difference we need more enforcement or a four way stop at otis to slow down traffic sb drivers block crosswalk during pm peak drivers speed on half st se during the am peak there is no northbound traffic here so bikes have to take a long detour up a large hill to martin luther king jr ave lots of bicyclecar collisions on sb 16th street from turning vehicles onto new hampshire consider restricting right turns onto new hampshire specially where bicyclists have 3 ways to go driving lanes curve and then condense down due to street parking drivers often disregard lane markings and swerve into other lanes drivers speed through crosswalk as one tries to cross poor pedestrian connections at this intersection going south on park road to get on michigan ave nw hard to see pedestrians crossing because of cars crossing on 10th and parked cars cross walk count downs keep getting messed up frequently jump from 34 to 15 seconds left to cross at certain times of the day water st becomes a unpredictable jumble of cars with motorists turning around backing into parking spots scanning for open spots this corridor heavily used by bikes peds with nearby cct waterfront traffic on 10th does not stop at this intersection but there is no sign on e warning that cross traffic doesnt stop its especially bad for eastbound drivers who can not see cars headed north on 10th until theyre in the intersection drivers do not stop for pedestrians in the crosswalk especially during morning rush hour this blocks road surface is in very poor repair and is dangerous to bike on lots of open seams and potholes this is a dangerous intersection cars are able to drive through both red lights and green lights causing cars not to slow down as they turn into vermont drivers go very quickly without looking there are hedges that block the view of oncoming cars the crosswalk is very short and cars often run the red light the hedges add an additional level of danger teenagers smoking pot all daynight and throwing garbage in the street grown men drunk onsellingbuying drugs gambling cat calling police do nothing but yell back at the men this is an unprotected crosswalk that should be a 4way stop sign drivers gain speed through this intersection down 14th st until they hit c st se northbound drivers often stop inside the crosswalk or dont stop at all this is a heavily used crosswalk the stop sign may not be visible enough to drivers signs are missing to restrict parking near the entrance of the alley drivers block the sidewalk as they inch into the intersection to see if it is clear to proceed the pedestrian walk signal to cross shepherd often does not illuminate even when the actuator button is pushed the stop bar for the euclid15th intersection is about 100 feet south of the actual intersection there is a crosswalk just north of the stop bar leads from the park to the east side of 15th cars blow through the stop bar and the crosswalk a crosswalk is needed here on 16th street people walk down spring place to get to the soutbound bus stop and it is difficult to cross the street the crosswalk on spring road is too far away crosswalk needed to connect the east side of quincy to the west side of 14th street quincy is used by many pedestrians the crosswalk to the north could be removed because the west side of quincy is a dead end everyone could use the new crosswalk the street car is already a total hassle during the day when commercial vehicles are stopping for deliveries the street car cant change paths obviously and it creates a huge headache and what happens when a firetruck or ambulance is stopped the sign is confusing and cars still run through the intersection without concern for others at the intersection of 12th and g streets se there are no actual red stop signs on 12th street for cars driving either north or south instead of normal red stop signs there are yellow signs many drivers drive straight through that intersection cars fail to yield for pedestrians we live close to this intersection at 12th and g se which presents a clear safety issue due to the intersection not having a four way stop this is especially dangerous to pedestrians as many drivers speed through the intersection a good example of how not to make bike lanes this should be reverted to 4 lanes as it was a year ago the bike lanes are way to narrow to be safe cars constantly block the box at rush hours drivers routinely ignore the red left turn arrow here some drivers are oblivious to the red light while others try to sneak between bikes but they ignore that pedestrians are also using the crosswalk please enforce the angle of this intersection makes for very long crosswalks bulbouts would significantly improve the safety and visibility of pedestrians in this very busy intersection the intersection at 12th and g se needs to be a fourway stop to reduce driving speeds around this corner and reduce the number of auto accidents we neighbors have witnessed several auto accidents here in a matter of months its not safe as it is i was struck by a uturning driver in the 1100 block of penn ave nw in early 2012 its time to get serious about safe infrastructure and ticketing illegal driving without fail one or more cars runs the red light on h during every cycle in the evening the signals may not be visible enough to drivers but a red light camera would be a start there is a stop for pedestrians sign there but not being obeyed there have been a large number of near misses traffic has steadily increased going down 12th st speeding drivers routinely ignore the red left turn arrow here some drivers are oblivious while others wait to go on red after bikes have passed but they ignore that pedestrians are also using the crosswalk please enforce police cars often block the sidewalk here forcing me to walk on the rutted crossslope of the driveway ramp with my stroller the curbapron on the nw corner of 18th and q is less than 4 years old but it floods every time it rains this forces pedestrians out into q or 18th street to get around near side traffic signals are completely obscured by trees and can not be seen by cyclists in the cycle track there used to be a speeding camera at nj ave for cars traveling eb on m street se now that the camera is gone its almost impossible for me to turn from 2nd st se onto m st se on my bike on the southbound lane 4th street cars park in the middle of bike lane for most of the day and never appear to get ticketed brand new configuration of the secret services entrance could benefit from a painted box for bikes to queue so that we dont block access to the entrance lane inbound drivers dont turn into us and pedestrians dont walk where bikes are queuing during the morning commute drivers turning left from south dakota northbound onto riggs westbound habitually run the red left turn arrow light there are usually at least three to four cars taking that left who block the box cars turning left from 1st pl onto riggs do not respect pedestrian crossing on more than one occasion i have gotten stuck in the median because cars failed to stop for me to finish crossing the road to the far side north side of riggs when driving up norht 3rd st and intending to take a left to 2nd st the driver is completely blind to any oncoming southbound traffic on 3rd st this is due to the hill that is at its peak at the intersection of 2nd and 3rd st cars tend to go very fast on 3rd st at least 15 miles over the speed limit on average during peak commuting times there is not a single cross walk to cross from the south side of 3rd st to the north side of 3rd st the nearest place to legally cross 3rd st is nicholson st ne during peak commuting times northbound vehicles turning left onto riggs rd tend to run the red left turn light on average three to four cars block the box during each light cycle cars turning left onto riggs from 1st pl dont respect pedestrians crossing from the south side of riggs to the north total disregard of crosswalk by drivers if the penn ave light is green cars traveling northbound on 3rd st from riggs or south dakota are forced to take a blind left turn onto 2nd st furthermore the cars traveling south on 3rd tend to go very fast this left turn is extremely dangerous without any stop signs there is nowhere to cross from the south side of 3rd st to the north side of 3rd st the nearest crosswalk with a stop sign for cars is nicholson when walking down chillum towards 2nd st there is no place to cross over 3rd st the intersection of chillum and 3rd is a logical place for a stop sign drivers speed at least 10 15 mph over the speed limit during peak commuting times due to the traffic issues at riggs south dakota drivers try to take 3rd st as a shortcut and put pedestrians in danger on g street between 11th 12th streets is a one way street cars are repeatedly going the wrong way and speeding down g street seems very dangerous frequently almost hit by drivers running red lights on riggs rd headed in both directions especially towards maryland in the morning and towards n capitol in the evening frequently complained to ddot about drivers running stop signs with pedestrians especially school aged children during morning and evening rush hours accidents frequently occur at this intersection due to drivers not stopping at the red light andor speeding through the intersection avg of at least 2 accidents per month i frequently almost get hit by vehicles running the red lights by all three directions at all times of the day the walkway at this intersection is unsafe and treacherous during the winter months with ice and snow buildup slip lane at 3rd street north carolina avenue ne promotes speeding automobiles right outside of a school curb should be extended and the turn changed in to a normal turn with sharper angles to slow down drivers slip lane here at quebec street connecticut avenue nw is dangerous and promotes speeding by motorists i suggest the slip lane be removed and the curb extended to end frequent nearmisses observed here weekly accidents and near accidents at this intersection typically in the mornings cars going southbound from new hampshire to north capital routinely run this red light and create serious backups this impacts northbound and southbound traffic on north capital the road in this section of blair road is in seriously bad shape instead of patching entire sections need to be resurfaced pedestrians trying to cross massachusetts have no pedestrian signal and can not see the traffic signal drivers have on massachusetts pedestrians trying to cross massachusetts have no pedestrian signal and can not see the traffic signal drivers have drivers frequently run the red lights in all directions at this intersection creating an unsafe environment for crossing the street in all directions drivers never yield to the stop sign in all directions particularly during morning and evening rush hours drivers frequently make left turns onto first st ne during the morning commute violating the signs informing them not to creating a large number of commuter traffic in the neighborhood running through stop signs to save time drivers run this stop sign in a lot of cases without even slowing down not yielding to pedestrians and almost striking them in some cases raised crosswalks or some other deterrent is needed cars frequently run the red light allowing pedestrians to cross regardless of the signage saying no turn on red creating an unsafe environment for crossing new hamp ave extremely dangerous crossing as the crosswalk is directly under a traffic light leading drivers to assume there is a ped signalphase there is no such phase requiring peds crossing irving tofrom hospital here to run to avoid being hit extremely dangerous crossing in area with frequent speeding requiring peds crossing irving tofrom hospital here to run to avoid being hit disconnected ped route a crosswalk is missing here sidewalk on the michigan ave bridge ends at the nb irving ramp with no protection for crossing tofrom hospital roadway network appears incomplete here missing wb michigan ave ramp to nb irving st eb michigan ave ramp to nb irving st sb park ave ramp to eb michigan ave i love the new layout of this area after it was reconstructed but peds have to wait a long time to get a walk especially on south end of intersection from zoo to harvard st peds should get walk when traffic from rock creek parkway has red lanes seem very wide on klingle in this area since klingle is one lane west of here can we remove one lane and add bike lane for part of it cars travel quickly and its intimidating it doesnt seem necessary to have two openings onto woodley pl from calvert for cars to enter creates a long distance for peds to cross even with mountable island in the intersection huge tree heaving up sidewalk on west side of 15th street here very difficult to get by on foot even without needing accessibility assistance traffic heading nb new jersey at this stop sign look left for oncoming traffic but never right for cyclists plenty of row here for a protected bikeway on nb new jersey to enable safe bike passage through the 2ndnew jerseyk st intersection very wide intersection given the angle it is sometimes terrifying to cross 18th street in the location due to cars making a left from potomac ave due to the high speeds of cars on potomac and the location of parked vehicles pedestrian visibility is low several close calls perhaps because the light timing is off or because pennsylvania ave is so overbuilt for the amount of vehicular traffic jaywalking here is epic and epidemic every cycle during am and pm rush dozens of pedestrians cross pa ave against the light southbound cars on 16th making the right onto m often fail to stop for pedestrians in the crosswalk left turn arrow for vehicles onto nebraska pedestrians step into crosswalk with a do not walk sign unless you want to wait 10 minutes jaywalking is the only option with the very used hamilton park on this block a midblock crosswalk is needed for the many pedestrians including kids that cross every day big risk to tourists and people working nearby cars often run red lights here a speeding camera is needed or a stobe red light drivers block cycle tracks and there is no safe cycle route through this intersection traffic light needed at this intersection traffic exiting joyce rd to 16th st has poor visibility and it is very dangerous to merge also southbound traffic on 16th st blocks the intersection when stopped for the traffic light at fort stevens dr should add a sign that downtown traffic heading south on mass ave has a delayed green light so northbound when the light turns red the southbound continues pedestrians should be warned constant illegal uturns very dangerous please install barriers before someone is killed this is on you dc cars do not stop at the stop sign at the end of potomac ave bicyclists heading eastbound off harvard enter michigan ave where drivers have the road infrastructure to get up in speeds very quickly the block is one giant pothole which is very dangerous for cyclists and frustrating for drivers this may be the worst block in the district ive submitted multiple repaving requests over the last few years and nothing has been done motorists turn left against red arrow constantly i see this multiple times a month very dangerous for cyclists and pedestrians drivers exit north capitol st and use this network of alleys to quickly connect to michigan ave the speed limit is not obeyed and soon they will convert both alleyways into one way alleys and speeding is going to become an even greater issue motorists turning from westbound potomac avenue fail to yield to pedestrians here because of poor visibility of crosswalk consider sidewalk extensions to force a more perpendicular turn onto or out of e st and potomac avenue southbound motorists on 18th st often turn right without stopping causing a hazard for pedestrians crossing potomac avenue at e st se motorists speed down the hill in both directions during offpeak hours speed camera needed this is close to a blind intersection for cars turning right headed northwest onto blair rd from carroll st the crosswalk is hidden around the corner and because cars often turn at speed there is a constant risk of collision its very unsafe this is a big intersection of bicyclists and runners coming onto beach drivercp bike paths but theres just a couple of stop signs and a yield sign barely any sidewalk no crosswalk etc cars turning right onto piney branch can go very fast cars including police cars constantly blow through this intersection without stopping especially when turning right onto 12th pedestrians walk on vehicle right turn green arrow and they do not have walk sign bicyclists frequently use the sidewalk headed northwest on blair rd between dahlia and piney branch due to the narrow and congested vehicle lanes but the sidewalk is also very narrow and with several blind curves its dangerous for pedestrians cars speed and theres no bike lane car parking is fairly sparse so drivers tend to pressure bikes to move over into the parking lane to get out of their way please take out parking along the bus barn and add separated bike lanes street needs repaving car drivers speed here in both directions cars speed through here and dont stop for pedestrians in the crosswalk especially bad at rush hour big risk to tourists the light takes so long that people just start walking across the street this crossing needs a countdown crossing indicator and the lights need to be retimed for shorter duration waits the intersection is very confusing because the light at decatur only points southbound and is either red or flashing yellow but theres another light at georgia and iowa neither cars nor pedestrians know what to do cars are often double parked waiting for spots cars turn right across the bike lane even when the red arrow is signaling them to stop big risk to tourists the light takes so long that people just start walking across the street this crossing needs a countdown crossing indicator and should not be a must press button crossing as it is now also cars tend to block the crosswalk cars rarely stop to allow pedestrians and or cyclists to cross speeds are often very excessive big risk to tourists the light takes so long that people just start walking across the street this crossing needs a countdown crossing indicator and should not be a must press button crossing as it is now livery and official vehicles waiting in front of the va often back to far into parking spots partially blocking the bike lanes additionally many idle here for long periods of time creating a tunnel of exhaust no easy pedestrian route pedestrians are forced to walk completely around the circle to reach this cars frequently make a right hand turn here into crossing pedestrians the street crossing signal needs to turn green before the traffic light turns green theres not enough time to cross both 15th and florida and im an able bodied adult if you dont make it you have to wait a long time to cross florida or 15th 20 seconds doesnt seem like a long time a pedestrianactivated flashing crossing light is needed here need real bike facilities for this stretch the sidewalk on the eastbound side is hazardous has many sharp turns and crosses onoff ramps for this highway very hard to walk across this intersection extra long light here if pedestrians are walking across t street cars speed through here at 50 mph ridiculous illegal parking every sunday and when church events are going on cars parked right up to the corners make it hazardous for drivers and pedestrians to see each other zero response from the city and such easy targets ticket and tow this intersection is one of the worst in the city traffic from all angles eckington pl ny ave fl ave are routinely backed up and cause congestion for pedestrians drivers and cyclists at this intersection a traffic study would be helpful traffic driving from and to broad branch drive fail to yield and stop to traffic traveling southbound on beach drive the no turn on red sign on eastbound s street above the red light on the far side of connecticut avenue is very difficult to see at night many motorist either dont see the sign or ignore it car drivers are many times confused by the green light for bicyclists and will proceed to make a left turn across the bicyclists crossing 15th need a more prominent red light for cars this part of the trail needs repaving since its in a bad state of repair cars traveling southbound on blair rd and stopped at piney branch often fail to stop behind the line which then blocks cars making the sharp right turn from piney branch onto blair the existing intersection markings are not clear enough cars are often double parked in the bike lane the sharrow marked lane is a parking lane on sunday and is blocked by the line for the dmv inspection station other days line cutters during rush hours back up the traffic on the correct lane onto beach drive more enforcement is needed im almost hit at this light at least once a week drivers including circulator drivers constantly run and it and theres zero enforcement cars turning left from westbound michigan ave onto 4th st ne frequently run the red turn arrow often they continue to turn at high speeds when pedestrians have the rightofway i have seen several nearmisses at this intersection there is often horse excrement in the cycle tracks pedestrians in the crosswalk are at great danger here since cars will not stop this stretch in front of the giant on park rd is a complete mess due to the persistent doubleparking its totally unnecessary due to the ample offstreet parking in the attached garage the parking rules need to be enforced and strengthened someone runs the red here almost every cycle during evening rush hour its absurdly dangerous cars do not stop for pedestrians in the crosswalk during evening rush hour the light will cycle through multiple times without allowing crossing m st or traffic to go through the light off the navy yard sidewalks much to narrow crossing connecticut from rite aid to the russia house for example when biking on l between 9th and 11th to get to m street bike lane or 11th st lane i usually take full lane to avoid parked car doors drivers consistently pass very close usually over the double yellow to get around only to meet me at the red witnessed a driver yell at biker for being out of bike lane driver then cut off biker and threatened to hit him very aggressive drivers up and down 14th also why no option for driver behavior vehicles use excessive speed down 2nd st ne nearly every single day i live on this street and have witnessed near accidents due to high speeds on many occasions car frequently parked farther west than allowed on the westbound side of the street they are generally in the bike lane where it curves forcing bikes into traffic right before the intersection westbound cars always block the crosswalk creating a real hazard for all drivers on 2nd street routinely come to a rolling stop and continue down the road at unnecessarily high speeds westbound cars can hardly see pedestrians stop sign frequently run by cyclists and drivers heading east or west on r street stop sign frequently run by cyclists and drivers heading east or west on r street crosswalks are popular with families the elderly an dog walkers creating a dangerous mix stop sign frequently run by cyclists and drivers heading east or west on r street crosswalk busy with visitors to dumbarton oaks and other pedestrian types dangerous situation eastwest traffic on calvert street has a very short light to cross stop sign frequently run by cyclists and drivers heading north or south on 37th street cars taxis and delivery trucks loading and unloading frequently block the bike lanes both northbound and southbound forcing a dangerous squeeze of road users poorly situated and coordinated traffic lights have users drivers and cyclists frequently running lights and causing dangerous situations with cross traffic people run the stop sign on gallatin at 11th all the time some dont even slow down please consider getting rid of all streeetside parking on m street nw in georgetown and reapportion street space to protected bike lanes heading both east and west this will make the road safer for all users drivers dont always follow the lane shift assuming they can drive in the eastbound parking lane of m st that acts as a cycling refuge during morning rush hour please paint new brighter lanes that more clearly show the lane shift through the inte cars and taxis frequently double park in the r street nw bike lane near the 17th street nw entertainment district causing dangerous mixing of user modes pedestrians crossing massachusetts have no signal and can not see signal on massachusetts cars and taxis on q street nw frequently block the bike lane near the 17th street nw entertainment zone forcing cyclists into the main traffic lane in a dangerous squeeze drivers and cyclists frequently run this stop sign many pedestrians cross against the light while staring at their phones here drivers an cyclists frequently run this stop sign regardless of direction of travel or presence of pedestrians in the crosswalk the pennsylvania cycletrack should have stops that prevent uturns on all of the blocks the fact that the ones on the blocks between 15th st and 13th st in front of the wilson building are under study is ridiculous light is too short for cars and new circulator route has made matters worse peds have green light on second half of cross but cars are turning right at the same time ive seen numerous nearmisses cars travel at very high speeds cars routinely treat this segment of 2nd st nw as a speedway to get to the light at ri ave the staggered intersection at tthomas poorlymarked crosswalks and rampant stopsign running along 2nd st also dont help this intersection has a fair number of pedestrians crossing to access the grocery store cars on piney branch tend to speed because the street appears wide and do not stop for pedestrians curb bulbs a stop sign and median refuge would help the lowcontrast bricklooking material for this crosswalk is pretty but not up to its important job cars routinely block the curb cuts here in part because the crosswalk is poorly marked on the pavement and cars rarely stop for pedestrians the bike lane on this stretch of 11th disappears leading to lots of conflict between carsbikes ive nearly been hit twice in the past year i follow all traffic laws but find that everyone is confused the bike lane ends need a bike box here to make left turns this intersection has a lot of pedestrian traffic including kids and the crossings are very long making it difficult to safely cross this is also a local business district and bulbouts at intersections would improve the area for all cars routinely double park even when there is plenty of street parking available due to low enforcement many kids walk to school in this area and commuters routinely speed due to wide lanes and no stop signs each intersection could have a stop sign and pedestrian bulbouts or raised crosswalks regular speeding on this section of sheridanconsider traffic calming improvements to make the area safer this intersection is directly across from two schools and sees a lot of pedestrian traffic drivers on both 5th and sheridan streets often speed andor do not yield to pedestrians would be much safer with raised crosswalk andor curb bulbouts several times a week cars turn north on montello which is a oneway street headed south one way do not enter signs would help visibility poor due to geographyheight differences between rittenhouse and 3rd on rittenhouse cars cant see traffic on 3rd on 3rd there is no stop sign at this intersections would be safer with stop signs on 3rd there is often a long line of cars in front of roses liquor store many drivers seem to be purchasing drugs they block traffic double parking or blocking the intersection the dealersdrunks also block the sidewalk drivers on 3rd often fail to stop at stop sign there is often a long line of cars parked in a traffic lane on florida avenue waiting to turn into macs tire at 423 florida ave ne dangerous as then cars fight to merge into the left lanes or just jerk their cars into the lane without looking cars speed down this road like crazy drivers coming north do not stay in their land at the same spot as cyclists and walkers are entering the mbt suggestion is to put barriers up in the center line to keep drivers moving slowly and carefully around the curve i ride on 7th every day and on average have to swerve into traffic at least twice to avoid cars stopped in the bike lane signed bike route is basically a speedwa highway onramp people drive way to fast on florida ave test when waiting to turn onto maryland extremely difficult to see whether there is any sw bound traffic on maryland ave approaching surface is extremely poor continues to degrade routine failure to yield at trail crossing high rates of speed poor sight lines at xwalk failure to yield routine failure to yield turns at high rate of speed the sidepath for this bridge is difficult for most bicyclists especially kids and people who are new to biking the cracks in the pavement the width the fencing drivers turning right from northbound 16th st onto alaska dont yield to pedestrians and cyclists and they take the turn very quickly often without signalling no crosswalk here confusing intersection what does the flashing light mean do pedestrians still have right of way in the crosswalk no one stops anyway car drivers cut across the bike lane and turn right even when they have the red noturn arrow bike route through lafayette sqmadison pl needs to be clearer are cyclists supposed to use the sidewalk here needs signage very difficult to yield to turning traffic when traveling south on rcp path traffic is coming fast and hard to tell if they are exiting onto k street when turned around from the direction im traveling have had some misjudged close calls very difficult intersection for bikes peds cyclists and walkers are not separated at all bike lane overly rough in this whole block cars headed we on florida frequently block the box and park in the crosswalk making it unsafe for pedestrians to cross florida either that or they blatently run the red light endangering others i regularly see cars speeding and failing to yield to pedestrians at the crosswalks drivers use this as a cutthrough to bryantnorth capitol this is a neighborhood cars zip along and dont stop for pedestrians in the crosswalk cars exceed the 15mph speed limit and then honk or act aggressively when im cycling in the lane in the mornings pedestrians like to cross when i have the green light completely ignorant to the fact that its dangerous for both of us the m st cycletrack between connecitucut ave and georgetown is in terrible condition pavement is so bad its painful to ride and unsafe as you bounce all over the place due to large cracks bumps etc terrible dangerous to cross all around this circle walkways need flashing lights or hawk signal cars are not looking for peds and are often speeding southbound drivers turning right on 20th st often do not yield to peds and can go very fast tree at the sw corner limits visibility of people about to cross bulbout uturn lane is unnecessary and takes up space that should be for pedestrians two lanes of right turns onto nj ave conflict with crossing pedestrians no xwalks on north or east legs of intersection how are people supposed to get across from the north sidewalk of virginia ave this intersection sees a lot of pedestrians and the street is very long to cross with wide lanes drivers often speed and dont see pedestrians could be improved with bulb outs or a raised crosswalk crossing n capitol street to access bus stops has become dangerous with drivers often failing to stop to allow pedestrians to cross and speeding in alleys behind channinggirard streets on increase to divert traffic on n capitol street help its very hard to turn left from channing st onto lincoln st heading south because of the parked cars all the way up to the corner you have to pull out into the lane to see when you can go there is no bike path anywhere along south capital or overlook ave there needs to be the lights for pedestrians are timed badly at washington circle not enough time to cross not enough time to cross need a bike lane down to dupont circle the light is timed badly only three cars can turn when left arrow is green cars then run the light to try to get through need a bike lane so we wont be traveling at high speeds down the sidewalk sidewalk not wide enough to accommodate pedestrians end up walking down frontage road tons of double parking need enforcement no bike lane the split is dangerous for bikers heading north on connecticut avenue at the split towards adams morgan tremendous amount of out of towners and vamd drivers double parking letting people out for the zoo door opening into traffic and bikers double parking for zoo see comment north of here lights timed badly drivers coming around circle and turning right on 23rd are blocking new hampshire avenue when nh light changes to green they can not go the drivers wanting to go right on 23rd have the red light sliplane at quebec connecticut avenue nw is dangerous and encourages speeding i would suggest removing the slip lane by extending the curb and creating a new pedestrian space sliplane here creates a dangerous situation and encourages highspeed maneuvers by motorists literally right outside of an elementary school where there are a lot of children walking i suggest removing the slip lane by extending the curb westbound traffic on o street nw trying to turn onto 23rd street nw has no sightline to oncoming traffic on 23rd at least where the present stop sign is located the condominium building blocks the view making turning extremely dangerous buses tour buses and occasional circulators often use the dead end part of water street to turn around causing dangerous interactions with other road users buses should not be allowed on water street west of wisconsin the diagonal nature of this intersection makes it hard for drivers to see pedestrians it would make more sense for this to be a stop sign and the block up doesnt need the stop sign cars many out of state routinely speed through this residential street despite it being very near to two schools speed humps should be considered to slow traffic to a residential speed the only way to get on foot from benning rd to kenilworth requires use of the sidewalk and the sidewalk outside pepco has power lines in the center of the sidewalk it is difficult for a bike to navigate for a wheelchair impossible as many others have mentioned there are constantly cars parked in the bike lanes you wouldnt tolerate cars parked in car lanes ticket and tow these people car drivers are simply aggressive here they turn from k onto 18th at high speeds often illegally from the center lanes on k car drivers speed down e street and then take turns on 17th at high speeds in two lanes they dont see pedestrians who have the right of way slow them down make it a 1 lane turn car drivers speed like crazy down e trying to make the light car drivers speed car drivers turning north on 17th from e have two lanes and cant see pedestrians very unsafe car drivers speed up to try to make it on to the parkway before the light changes very unsafe cars speed going south 21st st has 1 lane for vehicles until here when there are 4 all of the sudden bicyclists dont have safe passage instead it becomes a free for all where cars do whatever they want 4 lanes arent needed its 1 above and 2 below cars double park at state causing other cars to swerve making dangerous conditions no accommodations for cyclists here theres plenty of space but no room for cyclists to proceed with safety cars double park on the right and speed on the left car drivers ignore the no turn on red sign theres no crosswalk on the west side of this intersection and only 15 seconds to cross on the east after waiting at least a minute why does dc hate pedestrians car drivers pick up speed going downhill when traveling north on 22nd pedestrians have a crosswalk here but car drivers never stop pedestrians have a crosswalk here but car drivers dont stop speeding car drivers make the road dangerous they dont stop for pedestrians no crosswalk on west side of street forcing pedestrians there to wait an ungodly amount of time or jaywalk why is there no crosswalk cars speed trying to make lights frequent car accidents fender benders intersection of ncapfranklin ne due to more traffic on street in general in past couple of years drivers dont anticipate the need to stop more than usual when light changes at mich avencap comment frequent car accidents fender benders intersection of ncapgirard ne due to more traffic on street in general in past couple of years drivers dont anticipate the need to stop more than usual when light changes at mich avencap no accommodation for bicyclists tell me how are cyclists supposed to go west here to get to the pa ave cycle lanes no bike accommodations on constitution the senate parking lot is often blocked off unbelievable how fast cars travel on this road please help there should be two crosswalks going into the whole foods very difficult for both cars and bikes to see each other as they pull into the 17th m office building parking lot although the cars on massachusetts have a light a pedestrian on 7th has neither a pedestrian signal nor a traffic light visible two northbound traffic lanes encourage speeding replace 1 northbound lane with a cycle track which matches 1 southbound traffic lane speed of cars coming across the river is way too fast side walk here is basically impassible full of glass and the electrical poles are in the middle of the sidewalk these walk signs are not timed to be able to cross the street big numbers of pedestrians often forced to wait in median while cars go past at very high speeds cars driving aggressively and over speed limit cars turning right dont stop walk light isnt sufficient this intersection is a mess tour buses regularly block the bike lane here in the morning to unload passengers car drivers like to turn right from independence to nc even though its clearly marked as illegal as a result they often block traffic and of course create a dangerous situation for pedestrians who dont expect the cars to be traveling this way there is no clear safe way to connect from the soutbound park pl bike lane to eastbound michigan ave no provisions for bicycles on this part of 20th street the street is 4 lanes wide surely there is room for bike facilities cars regularly speed past and fail to stop for pedestrians never enough time to cross the street and cars are going way too fast pedestrians jaywalk here constantly because they dont have enough time to cross the street cars traveling on 8th st dont stop for pedestrians all the cross walk paint has fadedworn out along d st needs to be repainted pedestrian crossing for military rd is ridiculous it requires peds to make 3 crossings each time waiting on an island that provides dubious safety dc code 50220128 requires peds be given a safety island if crossing is interrupted this intersection needs to be a four way stop cars often speed up and down the street to show off for the people hanging out and selling drugs there are a collection of dirt bikers and atv riders who speed across this bridge doing wheelies many days this goes on all day long stop sign needed on 10th st at this intersection there is a lot of confusion at this intersection because there are only stop signs on o st but not 10th st but there are stop signs or traffic lights at all the other intersections on 10th st extreme pedestrian hazard i have nearly been hit while trying to reach the metro here at least 25 times drivers travel far in excess of speed limit and exhibit active hostility to pedestrians light to cross nh is triggered by a sensor outside of rush hour bicycles are not large enough to trigger only can get a green if car comes up behindwestbound traffic only triggers a green for westbound eastbound remains red extremely high speeds on this stretch and no speed limit signs or enforcement have been victim of aggressive driving repeatedly for driving in the 2530 mph rangeincluding drivers passing to the right in bike lane someone is going to die here drivers often run red light here because they dont want to wait i routinely see people stop look around and then drive through the light perhaps retiming would help may as well eliminate redgreen arrows for right turns from 20th to l as only about 20 of drivers obey them i have seen 2 pedestrians struck here since march and the drivers yelled at the pedestrians and drove away cars traveling on 11th do not stop for pedestrians at this intersection its the only intersection along this stretch that lacks either a fourway stop or traffic light confusing sb traffic on 5th has flashing yellow pedestrians crossing 5th have no signal in crosswalk flashing yellow should mean yield but drivers speed through to make green at rcc rd drivers are hostile to peds who try to cross bike lane moves from right side of road to left side as road curves and bike traffic continues north up warder at rush hour is dangerous for bikes to cross in high speed traffic drivers seem confusedhostile signageeducation needed there is a crosswalk across georgia but it is extremely dangerous cars simply do not stop pedestrians need to wait until it is clear there needs more visibility to drivers that this is a crosswalk dangerous intersection this needs to be a four way stop sign i live on georgia and constantly watch cars gunning it from the stop light on decatur to buchannon they reach ridiculous speeds sometimes and it is very dangerous there are kids playing in the neighborhood going south on 7th right before crossing florida there are three lanes one clearly marked turns left the other two have no arrows but only the middle one goes through all three lanes need arrows because it it confusing intersection is a mess only one lane to turn left onto rhode island that is always backed up the other light same goes for the lane turning left into the shopping center from rhode island needs 2 left turning lanes on this long downhill drivers will sometimes encounter a slowermoving car in front of them and will pass traffic on the right in the shoulder this is very dangerous are there two travel lanes here or just one the portion of eastern towards nh ave has two marked lanes but once you cross the hill and head towards kansas ave all road markings disappear but there was no merge what to do cars run this stop sign with some regularity if no one is approaching from crittenden drivers feel that there is no need to stop in conjunction with the speeding issues on eastern this intersection is dangerous cars park right up to the end of the curb blocking all visibility numerous accidents have resulted watched four policemen in two cars sit and do nothing about double parked cars in both travel lanes completely stop traffic on taylor street at 11am they were too busy chatting away to care about anything outside of their nonwork related conversati need high visibility pedestrian crosswalk on weekday mornings there is excessive traffic backup on blagden because drivers traveling toward the city on beach dr have no stop sign at this intersection and drivers struggle to safely make a left from blagden east bound riggs drivers turning onto south dakota cant see pedestrians waiting to cross until they have started their turn onto south dakota lots of rightonred at this intersection routinely yelled at by drivers to get out of the way so they can make the turn even though no right on red is clearly signed crossing 5th is frighting drivers accelerate to reach green light immediately ahead and are looking only at light not at pedestrians needs pedestrian signage and speed enforcement cars traveling ns bound on 4th usually roll through this stop making left turn from elm on bicycle is very dangerous as cyclists are seemingly not visible and cars do not anticipate cross traffic at intersection in morning rush many drivers make left turn to remain on ri ave from far right lane straightright only as middle lane is straightleft this creates danger for any driver or cyclist who has the misfortune to be following the law its worrisome to cross here drivers apparently feel that since there are 4 lanes of travel the crosswalk doesnt count better enforcement needed drivers who encounter a long line headed southbound in the am often feel that they can create a second travel lane in the shoulder and will just cruise past all other drivers who are waiting for their turn i am of normal healthmobility and have trouble crossing the long way across the intersection from cvs to the eastern metro entrance within two light cycles needs curb extensions to shorten distance or barnes dance to facilitate crossing speeding is huge issue on this stretch of eastern ave though the speed limit is 25 mph because it is entirely residential it is completely ignored cars turning right from 13th st onto kansas usually at high speed as if it were not a right trun fail to stop for pedestrian crossing kansas at quebec place with the walk light drivers routinely use the bike lane on 7th bw fl ave and ri ave as a passing lane worst at r and ri ave where bike lane is dominated by drivers turning right but you dont know which ones will merge left having passed the congestion dangerous when biking nb on 4th st crossing il ave i am often nearly hit by cars traveling sb on il who blow the stop sign or roll through but do not look to see if the way is clear intersection is victim of bad angles cars required to stop going nb on il legitimately can not see whether anyone is coming south on 4th may require removing 12 parking spaces to correct very difficult to cross here high speed traffic uturns and distracted drivers looking only for parking traffic backs up in rushhours to the point that pedestrians are forced to dodge between cars which keep trying to move even then roadway of 4th st bw shepherd and il needs resurfacing many potholes and loose gravel from attempted repairs makes biking hazardous routine failure to stop for pedestrians for traffic coming south on 21st usually the westbound traffic on n is a little better cyclists do not stop at the stop sign when coming south on 21st just 14 seconds to cross 18th st on the north side of l st the walk light to cross k st is very short and cars coming northbound on 15th always run the red lights there is no crosswalk like on the southside of this intersection this is very dangerous because there is a green right arrow for eastbound o st traffic thus pedestrians crossing on the south side walk right into cars crossing with the light cars do not often stop at the crosswalk cars often block the bike lanes especially at the stop lights in order to beat the red light it gets a bit hairy on this road to bicycle because cars are speeding and there isnt much space the pedestrian signal here on the west side of 14th is very old and is barely visible pedestrians never know if they can cross this ped signal should not be actuated but rather it should be automated this location is one block from the metro there are numerous bus stops nearby and a number of schools cars turning onto 21st st from m st often pay little attention to pedestrians the traffic signal gives pedestrians a jump start but at rush hour all bets are off needs attention to increase pedestrian safety this intersection has a long history of dangerous stop sign running it is near both an elementary school church and an area that has generally high pedestrian traffic this part of m st is bananas the road goes from 3 lanes to 5 and then back to 3 meanwhile the bike lane disappears the result is pure chaos car drivers do absolutely anything they want and bikers are very vulnerable car drivers love to turn right onto k while traveling south bound on 15th even though theres a no right on red sign they also get very aggressive about it even though theyre doing something illegal traffic backs up from the dupont red lights back through this light on both new hampshire and 20th yields a gridlocked intersection and pedestrians being forced to weave through cars to legally with the walk sign cross 20th cars and metrobuses routinely go through the red lights on both the inner and outer loops of dupont circle especially if they were backed up in traffic before the light changed if you are on quincy trying to cross kansas from east to west it is nearly impossible to see cars coming from the south until they are on top of you cars scream up and down kansas making it difficult to cross the street at quincy drivers have hard time navigating turn from northbound south dakota west onto riggs and end up running the left arrow light should paint turn lanes to assist there is a crosswalk here and lots of kids crossing 5th to get to school but no stop sign and drivers routinely speed as they approach the light at 5thsheridan would be helpful to have a stop sign or a raised crosswalk cyclists often run red lights all along 11th drivers going south do not often see cyclists going north very difficult to left turn for cyclists the light timing here is ridiculous someone waiting to walk west to m st waits a long time to cross the circle and then has to immediately wait for drivers going east on the leg of mass ave crossing the entire circle can take 3 minutes car drivers going south around the circle make it to this point see open road and just let it rip highly dangerous since the terrible light timing encourages a lot of pedestrians to jaywalk this threeway intersection is between results the gym and garfield park which is used by hundreds of kids tennis players volleyball payers dog owners etc cars heading south to the highway entrance regularly speed and do not yield to pedestrian cars fly around the corner from georgia onto nh rarely using turn signals a lot of people cross here to get to metro and the only safe way to cross is against the light because at least you can see cars south on nh really dangerous during both morning and afternoon commute there needs to be a 4 way stop here i have lived on this corner for many years and cars can not see pedestrians and therefore no one stops moreover cars coming down taylor can not see the cars traveling along new hampshire ave this is a really hard intersection for pedestriansthe distance to cross is long and dangerous and it takes several minutes to cross the street during times of high traffic volume because there are so many different signals drivers heading northbound on 5th street can not see the intersection due to the hill south of quackenboss and enter the intersection at high speeds it would be safer to a stop sign on 5th to increase visibility east bound traffic undergoes a lane shift to the left as they cross the intersection but because of no directional lines in the intersection and a very wide right lane middle lane traffic veers into the right lane the west bound light for drivers turning from constitution ave is far too long and causes unnecessary traffic pile ups this is especially true in pm rush hour when there are basically no cars going west bound here there is zero enforcement of illegally parked cars on 19th street during afternoon rush hour particularly between penn and i street the timing for these two lights for north bound traffic is absurd once the southern e street light turns green the northern one turns red making it so no one can even make the light so everyone then blocks the box are vendor trucks exempt from traffic laws if not they should all be towed if they block the right lanes during rush hour there needs to be more advanced warning of the right turn lane ending for south bound traffic driver right turn from michigan onto north capital conflicts with pedestrian crossing due to delayed green for drivers with delay for walk sign so when both change they collide as pedestrians proceed into street please add a protected bike lane on penn ave between the white house and georgetown my partner was hit by a taxicab here driver turned right on red and struck her please add protected bike lanes here circulator bus drivers often pull away from the curb at the bus stop and through the stop sign without stopping again this often involves not yielding to pedestrians in the crosswalk as well very dangerous motorists drive park and stop in the bike lane during periods of congestion on this stretch very very very dangerous for cyclists since they need to weave through and around stopped cars to avoid motorists scream through this stretch which is terrifying if you are crossing the road in the crosswalk too many drivers cops and ambulances included are driving the wrong way down a one way street many use it as a shortcut to get to the mcdonalds at the end of the street there needs to be better signage or more importantly more enforcement we need a protected bike lane commuters heading into the city using 5th st routinely run the stop sign here making the crossing unsafe for students and elderly there is absolutely zero enforcement of illegally parked cars during rush hour these cars should be ticketed and towed the timing for the north and south bound lights here was recently shortened to 15 seconds with only one lane and many pedestrians sometimes only one car can even go through which leads to many drivers running this light drivers routinely go 40 mph in this tunnel there are constantly delivery trucks blocking traffic here during rush hour this intersection has a yellow blinking light instead of a green and is poorly timed with the light that follows directly after it causing a great deal of confusion for drivers at the least this should be a standard light the pedestrian cross walk to cross h street is only 18 seconds this is also the time for the green light going south so cars push through pedestrians the light on h street is 84 seconds the cars driving down h st speed because they have very long lights it is very dangerous for pedestrians who have to wait more than 80 seconds to cross h st motorists harass and intimidate cyclists on this bridge car drivers dont seem to understand that turning right on red means yielding to everyone else first they regularly push their way into and past the crosswalk despite the presence of pedestrians and cross car traffic cars traveling south on connecticut constantly run the light making this crosswalk incredibly dangerous better stoplight placement andor police enforcement would help make this safer cars going too fast running red lights car fail to heed existing signs to yield for pedestrians please implement the md avenue transportation plan it would greatly benefit md avenue and make the whole stretch much safer it is not clear whether pedestrians can cross or not i realized that there was a crosswalk halfway down the street towards 15th it would be great to move the crosswalk here or make it clear to pedestrians to move further down terribly dangerous crzay intersection for pedestrians speeding drivers swerving onto e street are very dangerous cars fail to yield to pedestrians crossing the street long poorly marked crossing cars fail to yield to pedestrians from every direction this is a really bad stop for drivers it is very confusing if you are driving and want to go onto blandensburg to know which way to go long and difficult to cross cars do not yield crosswalk in bad shape please repaint cars block the cross walk here constantly in the morningevening rush pedestrians forced to cross in traffic cars turning right from calvert onto connecticut frequently run this light putting pedestrians in the crosswalk at danger particularly those crossing east to west speeding cars running lights dangerous intersection please implement the md avenue planits taken far too long because of the hill there is very poor visibility for drivers a man was knocked down here a few months ago make it safer for drivers long way to cross four lanes md avenue plan would be of great help here long and difficult to cross poorly marked long way to cross cars fail to stop for pedestrians cars speed to make the light at this fourway stop few come to a complete stop and most enter the crosswalk before pedestrians have exited speeding cars consistently run this light bikers need lanes all up and down md avenue it is super dangerous aggressive drivers honk at them and try and run them off the road cars spped down md onto f and fail to yield to pedestrians cant see cars speeding around corner coming onto f street cant see speeding cars from md avenue turning ontot f street speeding cars turning onto g street are dangerous to pedestrians when cars have the green to shortcut from penn onto indpdnc pedestrians on indpdnc have the green to cross 3rd st but cars instead of going straight from penn to indpdnc instead turn left onto 3rd at high speeds straight into pedestrians crossing trash cans block the sidewalk on this block sidewalk also in poor condition on this block car do not follow signs to yield for pedestrians cyclists go the wrong way down d street which is one way trying to turn right onto d from 6th is dangerous as i look left for traffic but cyclists are coming the wrong way down d when i turn almost hit several bikeshare dmd has made it worse cyclists do not stop at any of the 3 lights going north on 6th by stanton park they blow right through them in response to comment about bikers forced onto bollards cyclists dont stop at this stop sign and when drivers are turning right onto md they have to maneuver around cyclists blowing around them on their right dangerous bc bikes dont stop needs to be a sign cap bikeshare station emphasizing that d is 1 way and they cant use their bikes and cycle west on d when two bikes attempt to pass each other they enter oncoming traffic street not wide enough for 2 way bike traffic cars bike lane between 4th and 5th needs to continue all the way down k street there should not be parking here at any time cars behave erratically pulling into center lane drivers speed slam on brakes for speed camera and then speed back up cars do not stop for pedestrians to cross the street even though there are signs saying it is the law there is a crosswalk but cars never stop for pedestrians because they dont see pedestrian signs single sign often obscured by trees so cars continue speeding down independence at high speeds combined with parking on street hard to look both ways jaywalking is most terrible around 8th it s bad all across h from 3rd to 14th there is a sign that says notifying pedestrians that they must yield to pedestrians in the cross walk the cross walk is barely visible and the sign is not big enough so cars buses and school buses speed past while pedestrians are in the cross walk need a bike lane to cross under the tracks cars drive far too fast on this block 7th between k and i especially in am school speed limit ignored needs speed bumps cars stop at incorrectly labeled stop sign no left turn during rush hour sign routinely ignored the current construction project on the 2300 block of l st nw puts large dump trucks in the curb lane bike lane and occasionally the travel lane blocking traffic and safe bicycle passage the pedestrian crossing over eastbound pennsylvania avenue is timed somewhere between 1015 seconds the westbound crossing is significantly longer it is never enough time to cross especially factoring in right turns from 3rd street this intersection isnt a 4 way stop but is frequently confused for one which causes dangerous situations although this is a 4 way stop cars on nc ave dont always stop drivers making the right turn onto n carolina from 6th heading northeast often fail to yield to pedestrians crossing n carolina this intersection is bonkers and coming from d going east has an extremely short crossing time drivers speed down 17th and then dont stop for pedestrians in crosswalk when driving north on 11th st se only option is right turn onto east capitol st on a green light no right on red at the same time pedestrians given walk light to cross east capitol st creating a dangerous carpedestrian situation this entire length of m street is an argument for a road diet the number of travel lanes available increases speeds additional and more visible pedestrians crossings plus the addition of a dedicated bicycle lane would boost safetyusability i st is great for biking but when you cant get across town without going down 2nd street which has no lane is very narrow and where cars give bikes no space to move youre basically telling people to chance it on k or h going west people dont pay attention to left hand turn signals at the intersection of massachusetts and 7th streets ne there are two consecutive traffic lights for drivers traveling towards the se one is a blinking yellow light and the second is a standard green light this causes confusion for drivers constant stop sign running in this area drivers heading nw on masschusetts frequently run the red light just as it is turning from green to red and turn onto 6th street particularly in the morning this prevents pedestrians from crossing long waits to turn on virginia pretty much any time of day backups frequent on rock creek parkway southbound there are 2 right turn lanes turning into 4 lanes of traffic drivers in both lanes turn in the 3rd lane from the right add a sign that directs drivers in right lane to continue north on 6th and drivers in left lane to stay left onto c st nemass av this on ramp to 695 is horrible i have been hit from behind here and seen at least a dozen accidents here one just last night in 2015 alone a stop sign needs to be at least place here cars dont yield to cyclists at this intersection before turning right onto eye street this is terrifying sometimes speeding westbound during am rush hour speedingdidnt the florida ave transpo project engineers confirm that rush hour lanes were not needed scary to walk on the sidewalks in the morning southbound 295 the right hand lane becomes an exit only lane there is a sign that states exit only well in advance of the exit however the sign is all in green at least the bottom portion should be in yellow to draw attention to the exit only need more crossing guards after 10am dont know where to cross with all the construction this stretch of brandywine is one way yet due to poor signage i constancy see drivers go the wrong way people speeding on suit land parkway i was hit in intersection vehicle was turning left and not paying attention people are shooting in this area the three roads 18th mass c converging and the angled avenue makes it difficult to see oncoming cars cars from potomac onto penn see the merge onto penn as a straight rather than right turn and so they frequently do not yield to pedestrians crossing with a walk signal fix give peds xing signal when all car traffic has red cars race to make the green light at 19th street and speed coming out of dc general cars do not stop for pedestrians trying to get to metro cars traveling eastwest bound on f street ne rarely come to a full stop at the intersection with tennessee avenue ne this is especially dangerous during school hours when more children are present traffic on constitution avenue frequently runs through red lights here nearly hitting traffic coming southbound on tennessee traffic frequently turns left on the red arrow cars in far left lane often veer into right lane during turn onto 11th causing accidents need barriers between lanes to prevent crossing over light is not long enough to allow for 11th street traffic to cross also many southbound drivers go straight through the left turn only lane nearly colliding with cars continuing south bound h street trolley car tracks are interfering and are going to interfere with safety and convenience cars turning right on mass ave do not yield to bikes continuing straight in bike lane with the east side sidewalk closed just south of albemarle on ct ave and the west side metro closed crossings at windom with a count down at 20 and i think a similar countdown at veazy for pedestrian is not enough time it can be extremely hard to merge into the roadway because the side road enters on a hill and it can be hard to see oncoming cars and there is no chance to gain any speed cars esp evening commuters speed to make the lights at the end of the park frequently failing to yield to pedestrians in crosswalks sidewalk closed on east side ct closed and metro entrance close on west side puts additional pressure on this crossing cars run this red light with shocking frequency there is no stop sign for southbound traffic on 14th street ne and cars rarely stop for pedestrians approaching or in the crosswalk a stop sign for all directions would be very helpful the lights at this intersection are very confusing with green arrows pointing in odd directions and a triangular intersection with multiple lights at various angles very difficult to determine who has green light or when legal to turn not enough time for northbound drivers on 11th to turn right onto east capitol especially if there are pedestrians crossing in the morning there is no way to access bike share stations on 17th street when coming from lafayette square without either taking a long detour riding on a sidewalk or riding against traffic dangerous place to cross with two lanes of oncoming traffic it can be a long wait if drivers to not stop and both lanes do not always stop at the same time this is worse than the other side of memorial circle because there are three lanes it is very scarydangerous to see fast moving cars coming off the circle and hoping all three lanes stop if a car has already stopped cars on mass do not stop for pedestrians in this crosswalk pedestrians should have a crossing light nearly impossible to see traffic on 8th street when youre trying to drive through on d street need a 4 way stop here will also help with pedestrians crossing cars dont stop for pedestrians no crosswalk this is one of the most dangerous intersections on capitol hill and very clearly should have a four way stop in the last year i have witnessed a pedestrian struck by a bicyclist and two car accidents routine speeding failure to stop for xing too much congestion related to trolly car tracks constant double parking on weekends during flea market and drivers pulling suddenly into bike lane without looking it is impossible to see oncoming traffic on tennessee when youre at the stop sign on e street this should be a four way stop the timing of the lights in this whole intersection needs a review the short cycle on 15th south creates red light running on both mass and independence please extend the parking to edge of block theres not a crosswalk or other traffic that is impacted by extending it this would improve late night parking issues thanks intersection is extremely confusing ive seen drivers run the because it is not clear which light they should be using the access to independence from south carolina is confusing people never use the light to merge onto 15thindy and merge with traffic on independence ave se against their light ive seen collisions happen here during rush hour lane markings faded or missing need to be repainted urgently drivers turning right onto t st from florida have a wide turn and dont slow down for peds crossing at the same time cars going north or southbound on 8th st speed up and fail to stop for pedestrians drivers routinely block the crosswalks and run the stop signs kids are almost hit here every day for cars going both north and south on 8th no turn on red during the day does not make much sense when 17th street se backs up commuters use c st se as cutthrough to 16th street to go south to potomac ave frequently cars race down c and pedestrians or pets crossing to homes or their cars are in danger can c be made one way westbound cars fail to yield to pedestrians on crosswalk this intersection is in desperate need of a traffic light ive lived in the neighborhood many years and have seen tons of accidents here both cars and pedestrianssome very serious very limited visibility and too many roads intersecting please this light stays green along with the 17th street stop sign so motorists speed through 18th street city buses speed on 15th street it is very dangerous as they go way too fast we need speed humps or slower buses collision with motor bike here on 71415 stop sign not visible and often ignored even if its seen this street was closed semilegally years ago by the zoo reopening it would reconnect neighborhoods to the park why is the bike lane on the left side of th e road it makes it dangerous to cross c st ne speed cameras make more sense here than anywhere else but rock creek parkway cars frequently exceed 3540mph which makes this park road unsafe for bikes when traveling south on 13th its unclear whether a left turn onto constitution is permitted or not nearly impossible to see traffic coming north on 13th needs a space for cars to turn into to wait for light to change to continue east on const there is no to cross oklahoma avenue between c st ne and benning rd ne right across 24th st there is a playground and cars sometimes go above the speed limit in this section because the road is straight oklahoma avenue ne has speed bumps between 25 st ne and benning rd ne bu t no speed bumps are present between 25th st ne and c st ne even though cars do speed along this section of oklahoma ave ne this ramps have poor visibility for both trail users and cars exiting and entering not many cars use the ramps in the first place why not close them due to low use or at the very least add stop signs before the crosswalks to make drivers stop even though there is a double yellow line on oklahoma ave ne vehicles cross it to reach 21st st ne having to speed across two lanes only to find pedestrians crossing at 21st st ne in addition this intersection gets blocked during rush hour with the new klingle trail there is no reason why we need all of these ramps closing all but two one to beach dr and one to klingle rd homes would reopen a large open space to people motorists do not come to a full stop nor do they yield to pedestrians here impossible to cross c st ne at normal human walking speed during rush hour the light is just not long enough rush hour is also a busy time for pedestrian to walk to the nearby metro as a result people jaywalk replacing 1 of 3 lanes with a cycle track would connect neighborhood to capital crescent trail jaywalking out of control when the x2 unloads riders people jaywalk accoss the street regardless of the traffic light unreal jaywalking here exiting this intersection is dangerous due to bad anglepoor visibility and traffic light cycle parking on this narrow street is dangerous to all users removing this parking lane used by only 23 cars would create space for bike lanes during rush hour it is impossible to get from the bike lane on north carolina ave ne to cross constitution and continue on north carolina ave ne deadend north dakota ave nw at 3rd st nw because few cars use this street and it creates an unsafe distance to cross large trucks vans and suvs parkstop very close to or upon the crosswalk here and reduce visibility so motorists who run the stop sign dont see crossing pedestrians speed cameras make more sense than anywhere else in the district with no shoulder it would be unsafe to pull drivers over and as a result they speed without regard for others more people walk and bike on this road on the weekends than cars do on the weekdays could cars be permanently rerouted via ross dr nw to better connect our park police cars drive on the bike and pedestrian trail instead of unlocking the gate as a result the trail is falling apart a few bollards at each end would end this illegal behavior due to extremely low traffic this street should be permanently closed to cars and converted into a trail needs bike lanes to better connect neighbors to rock creek park hillsunderused parking lanes encourage speeding and removing the parking lane on the walter reed side would have no impact on residents this street could add bike lanes to reduce unsafe lane widths many cars use madison st nw as a shortcut and turn at unsafe speeds adding speed bumps or add stop signs would help reduce this drivers especially those turning left onto jenifer fail to stop for peds in crosswalk drivers coming over this bridge fail to comply with dcmr 22005 which requires drivers to drive at an appropriately reduced speedwhen approaching a hill crest this in turn contributes to probs at 8th this part of porter is engineered like its a highway notwithstanding that its the only street with a sidewalk that one can take to get from cleveland park over to mt pleasantadams morgancolumbia heights cars tend to speed down i street and up and down 8th street as they approach the highway no one stops too busy and going to fast on m st se to stop for pedestrians despite existing signage saying its dc law theres no safe way to cross ny ave by bike in the ne quadrant it makes biking across town in the midnorth half of dc extremely difficult and dangerous drivers routinely fail to stop for peds when turning right on red illegally to boot commuters bypassing congestion on constitution and east capitol speed and run stop signs on a st ne northeast corner of 8th and m se has some dumpsters that make it difficult for both cars turning north onto 7th st and pedestrians crossing 7th st to see one another only a matter of time before someone gets hit there is a stop sign but no crosswalk because of this drivers roll the stop sign if they stop at all the stop sign on 6th across from orleans has a crosswalk and cars actually stop cars driving west on i routinely run the red light several seconds after it turns red commuter buses use east capitol street as an expressway during morning and evening commutes frequently driving 40 mph especially if the light at 15th and east cap is green very dangerous for pedestrians and elementary school children cars rarely stop for peds crossing in the new crosswalk outside of metro or are parked in the crosswalk on the west side of the street if a bus stops for a ped cars speed around in the left lane with zero visibility to crossing peds massive dips in the street so deep that some cars would high center not potholes street needs to be resurfaced many cars speed and also fail to stop at each stop sign on garfield street west of wisconsin speed humps would be helpful on every block also pedestrian cars making a right turn on florida west from ny ave frequently dont stop for pedestrian or cyclists in crosswalk there is often a long back up in this far right lane and not enough space for cars to turn right bc the light at ecki cars come flying down garfield westbound often fail to stop at this stop sign speed humps would be helpful on every block of garfield west of wisconsin cars frequently run red light on florida west at eckington pl before the wendys not the light after bc they see a green light just a few yards ahead and dont see the red light right in front of them drivers get confused with red lights and will often go thru this red bc they see green or moving cars ahead of them there needs to be a ped signal at this crossing construction site does not have a detoured bike lane and trucks usually are blocking the pedestrian detour cyclists are forced to use a travel lane anyone westbound on cathedral avenue who wants to turn left or right onto 34th st is at risk because this is a hill and visibility is terrible cars parked on 34th st make it extremely difficult to see northbound traffic there needs to be a no right on red sign on k st drivers tirning right on reddo not realize there are cyclists in the bike lane and only look left for traffic not looking right for cyclists current signage is not stopping this dangerous problem cars do not stop for pedestrians attempting use the cross walk to cross potomac ave occasionally cars illegally pass on the left side of a car stopped to allow a pedestrian to cross as soon as this section of potomac because 23 lanes one way going east cars speed pass this intersection to jockey for position to the front of other cars before making a left turn on 19th st bike lane ends cars pass dangerously close cars swerving into oncoming traffic lanes around blind curves crossing distances could be made much shorter here car constantly double ark in the bike lane here making it unusable need physically protected lanes it is extremely difficult to see southbound traffic on 14th when you are waiting to cross a st ne east or westbound at this intersection it is also dangerous for pedestrians as rarely do cars stop and often speed to make the e cap and 14th light car drivers speed like crazy here probably averaging 45 in a 25mph zone no enforcement at all rampant speeding here cars frequently cut through ames place and then this alley to get to 16th street and treat this alley as a normal street car drivers block the north crosswalk here pretty much every afternoon it forces people to walk all over and drivers start to move as pedestrians are trying to weave through them just terrible and dangerous people drive like maniacs here cars consistently speed through this intersection and on c especially during the morning commute coming from the east capitol bridge and on to c the lights are timed so that drivers have an incentive to speed and pass using the multiple lanes drivers turning right from c street westbound on to oklahoma ave speed through the intersection without looking for pedestrians drivers speed through this intersection both continuing on c and turning onto 15th signal is way too long for pedestrians here this leads to jaywalking which is dangerous even though there is a sign that says stop for pedestrians on the crosswalk no cars ever stop in fact they are speeding down the road and often honk if you cross before they pass cars double park blocking the bike lane pedestrians on the east side of 18th street m8st wait a long time to cross the street this leads to jaywalking and more dangerous behavior no sidewalk people are forced to walk in the street next to high speed traffic highly dangerous drivers speed quickly through this intersection disregarding pedestrians often dangerous situations are created as a result of one car passing another at a high speed on the supposed two lane portion of 15th in between a and east capitol car blast through this section way above the 25mph speed limit probably more like 45mph scary and quite dangerous car drivers speed through this area probably close to 45mph in a 25mh zone the crosswalk light to cross here is extremely short car drivers constantly block the east crosswalk at n connecticut especially in the morning ive never seen this enforced the street design seems to encourage this behavior the light to cross independence and mass ave are very short given the high pedestrian and vehicle traffic southbound on 14th this signal was just changed to shorten the amount of time given to pedestrians to cross ew completely unacceptable the light at this intersection is very short going southbound given the high pedestrian and vehicle traffic car turn aggressively across the west crosswalk the double turn lane seems to encourage this behavior what happened to the cross walk for this intersection this is one of the main crossing points for the metro traffic coming from the east capitol bridge continues to speed as it enters residential area back in parking should be allowed on both sides of 15th st given the width of the roadway there are increasingly scarce parking spots this could also increase safety as it would discourage passing on this section of 15th drivers merging here often speed and drive aggressively and recklessly with children walking to school drivers speed and drive aggressively using the multiple lanes to pass slower drivers especially during rush hour westbound driver blast through here after they reach the section with two lanes drivers are reckless and aggressive at this intersection when going onto constitution or continuing on north carolina given the proximity to maury this is a safety issue cars turning left sb onto 10th st from wb mass ave fail to yield to peds in crosswalk in their rush to avoid oncoming traffic cars make unsafe judgments and disregard peds in crosswalk drivers blast down rhode island ave drivers turn onto and off of these ramps at high speeds and rarely slow down or stop for pedestrians and cyclists in an area already difficult to have two cars pass cars are often double parked here during school hours the right turn from massachusetts onto north capitol has unsafe pedestriancar interactions every light cycle there needs to be a red arrow for right turners its dangerous this intersection needs a stop sign cars never stop for pedestrians long wait to cross i st in the morning lots of jaywalking as a result drivers turning from ne on columbia to east on euclid frequently make this turn very aggressively and narrowly miss pedestrians this turn should be banned no cars ever stop here for pedestrians or bikes even with a stop for crosswalk sign they speed through and get angry when they see pedestrians trying to walk drivers go incredibly fast here drivers turn onto and off of these ramps at high speeds and rarely slow down for pedestrians and cyclists drivers blast down this street drivers go very fast down nebraska the lights here are timed entirely way too long for pedestrians trying to cross 11th street minute long waits just invite jaywalking constant jaywalking at this intersection because there is too long a wait to cross d st moreover to get across mass and d st is pretty much a maze for pedestrians there is not enough time to cross benning road and cars are speeding here there is a bus stop on the other side of the street too so particularly dangerous there is no do not enter signs posted at this intersection like there are at the corner of fern and 8th cars traveling eastbound on geranium often turn right to travel southbound on 8th street which is one way northbound thomas circle is inefficient for pedestrians then they jaywalk and are at risk from cars that are going too fast retime the signals and add speed bumps for the cars sidewalk is closed across the street from giant going south on 3rd street just blocked off there is no safe way to get across here or get overto this bridge cars coming from 14th into thomas circle are often going too fast e capitol bike lane ends abruptly could it be connected to the penn ave bike lane cars coming south on 17th go extremely fast redlight running jeopardizes pedestrians this intersection is confusing for both pedestrians and drivers cars making righthand turns onto 23rd from virginia go barreling through the crosswalk across 23rd at f street pedestrians crossing 23rd are at significant risk southbound buses on 23rd often can not make lefthand turns onto f street and virginia avenue until their signal has turned red this is quite hazardous for pedestrians using crosswalks across f and virginia recommend a lefthand dedicated signal crossing here during the evening rush hour is very dangerous cars which have doubleland righthand turn often fail to yield to pedestrians the sidewalk on the western side of 7th street is very uneven and dangerous for both wheelchairs and strollers but also small children who might trip and fall on their way to school no sidewalks on this and other close blocks of blair rd mean that pedestrians walk in the road there is a charter school nearby and students are also walking in the street on their way to and from the metro there is no northsouth crosswalk here thats ridiculous and of course pointless because people cross anyway just without the benefit of safety from the painted crosswalk or the pedestrian signal serious speeding up and down 17th street its unclear how to safely enter the cycletrack here the right lane is for cars going straight and turning left making it unsafe to turn left from the bike lane cars turning onto this ramp do not stop when the right turn arrow turns red they wont stop for bikers or pedestrians who have to cross the ramp to proceed along the same side of maine avenue dc police should ticket these cars pedestrians enter the crosswalk during the dont walk cycle against the red light rushhour speeding is a problem car drivers do something very dangerous here when driving south on 12th they cant take a left onto constitution so i see drivers come down here then drive the wrong way on madison for 20 feet and go back north to take a right on constitution since the access roads to 295 and the local bridge into anacostia have opened south of 11th st se and m st se there are many speeding cars along 11th street who race from one light to the next traffic calming measures should be considered drivers unfamiliar with the traffic pattern around the park often dont see this light and dont even hit the brakes as they fly through it pedestrians crossing i street on the western side of 17th street are often unaware that cars turning left from 17th have a dedicated lefthand turn pedestrians cross when they should not endangering themselves and the cars attempting the turn cyclists ride on the sidewalk which is always thronging with large groups of tourists very dangerous for both cyclists and pedestrians as cyclists weave in and out to avoid hitting pedestrians there is no curbcut for wheelchairs or strollers crossing 5th street on the northern side of cedar cars making right turn on red fail to yield to pedestrians trying to cross 17th street in the cross walk with a walk sign drivers will often roll through the red lightturning east onto potomac from nb 17th street without even checking for walkers drivers turning east onto potomac ave from northbound 17th street often fail to yield to pedestrians trying to use the cross walk with a walk sign drivers often do a rolling stop through the red light to make this right turn onto eb potomac ave cross walks should be painted on 17th street for people crossing at g street cross walks should be painted on 17th street for people crossing at h street driver speed on potomac potomac is too wide which i feel encourages speeding pedestrians cut across pa ave walking over center median well outside any cross walk this happens in droves especially during rush hour there is not enough time to fully cross pa ave at any point you have to run to make it in the short amount of time provided cars fly down e st towards 19th very difficult to see them coming from 18th st also dangerous for pedestrians on e st delivery trucks park along the curb forcing cars and bicyclists to go around them bicyclists have to enter directly into the path of cars to get around the trucks ive seen trucks being ticketed in the 845 am timeframe but enforcement is lax bicyclists seem to think that stopping at this stop sign is optional it is not its a very busy fourway stop sign with a ton of pedestrians coming from the dupont circle south exit and the n street bus stop all cyclists need to stop at this sign cars speed down 14th street to beat the light at massachusetts ave they ignore the pedestrian crosswalk at 14th and a street se motorists run this light on a routine basis especially during the morning commute buses speed down this street and dont stop for pedestrians needs to be 3way stop the stop sign is located far from the crossing street due to the large crosswalk and there is a large end post as part of the park that inhibits one from seeing cars so people stop for the stop sign and then proceed to go without seeing others car the intersection of potomac avenue se and ninth street se lacks properly marked crosswalks to make matters worse ninth street se is a oneway street heading north from m street se drivers illegally drive south and speed through without stopping the crosswalk at 11th street se and the westbound on ramp for i695 needs better signage and maybe led lights to signal to drivers that pedestrians are crossing car drive fast on the new se freeway and dont look for pedestrians the mixing zone here simply doesnt work there are too many cars getting backed up so they just block the cycle track forcing bikes into the road eliminate the mixing zone give drivers a green arrow or ban left turns drivers speed on kentucky at extremely unsafe speeds to try and beat the light at potomac drivers fail to yield to pedestrians in cross walk drivers rarely yield to pedestrians in crosswalk timing of light is so short that only a few cars can make left onto pa ave from barney circle this causes a back up of cars onto barney circle and up 17th street 510 more seconds of green light would make a world of difference intersection needs both left and right dedicated turn arrows for 4th st for both north and southbound traffic turning on to m st often no or only one car can get through the light due to other traffic and pedestrians crossing cars on independence ave block this intersection regularly during the evening commute making it hard for pedestrians and cars to cross cant see cars coming down montello and people dont realize its not a 3way stop requested stop sign for several years with ddot last confirmation number was from barry 137577 buses and cars speed down montello and disregard the many signs indicating the dc law to stop for pedestrians in the crosswalk ive started to record the buses speeding and preparing to report them carsbuses speed never stop for pedestrians on montello needs to be a 3way stop neighbors been trying for years drivers cutting through potomac avenue se to get to 11th street se will run this stop sign there are no marked crosswalks or traffic calming measures despite a residential block and active park at virginia avenue park the crosswalk on the east side of 8th street se underneath the se freeway is dangerous since drivers heading eastbound for the onramp fail to stop for pedestrians many families walk through this intersection lots of cutthroughs by people trying to avoid c st traffic particularly early morning evenings and weekends needs speed bumps or similar many drivers do not stop at the zebra crossing confusion about two vs one lane at this intersection likely because of the bus stop people use two lanes to turn right which causes problems merging into the lanes on 6th because most immediately turn left on c the construction over in this region makes it very dangerous for bikers we are forced onto a small sidewalk where we as bicyclists become an issue for pedestrians adding in bike lanes on this road would help signs saying it is a one way street need to be more prominant people driving too quickly and making the turn on to cliffboure without looking people make hard right on red when it is illegalor should be drivers heading north and south on 8th street se fail to stop at the marked stop signs ddot needs to better mark the intersection maybe even with led lights to alert cars to stop drivers fail to stop at zebra crossing needs enforcement especially during school hours drivers fail to stop for pedestrians walking east and west on m street se embassy suites allows guests and taxis to block bike lane by parking massive suvs perpendicularly into bike lane cars frequently fail to stop and yield to pedestrians there is no good way to cross 9th st nw and vermont st nw on a bicycle to continue on westbound v st nw which has a bike lane on either side of the intersection the only safe legal crossing involves dismounting to cross at the cross walk this intersection has so many problems it is a free for all for cars going in different directions and people spilling out of the 930 club are going to get hurt there need to be more markings a stop light and a wider sidewalk on the east side cyclists consistently do not stop for pedestrians at this intersection far more often than cars failing to yield they furthermore blow through it at high speeds the bike light at this intersection does not work if cars turning left on 16th street pull into the intersection to complete the turn after the light turns red they are set up to run headon into the bikers that have the very short light confusing spot people jaywalk in front of cars making a right off the turn lane from k st westbound a crosswalk from the center of conn to the service road island and a ped signal in middle of conn ave could help cars routinely parkedidling in the bike lane in front of apartment building at 2325 15th st nw the hill is very steep at this point and a cyclist moving into the main lane of traffic is very vulnerable to faster cars coming around this curve huge pothole here i bike on this road everyday and there are always cars double parked on the road in the bike lane it being so close to south capitol st cars drive faster here than normal and it always feels like the least safe part of my commute this block needs a contraflow bike lane so cyclists going from woodley to calvert can stay off connecticut cars and large trucks turning from m st onto 19th often enter the crosswalk after the left arrow despite pedestrians in the crosswalk i have never seen any enforcement this block needs a contraflow bike lane so cyclists traveling north can stay off connecticut for drivers moving north quickly on florida few stop for likely because they do not notice this stop light cars frequently exceed the speed limit trying to pass as many lights as possible when going north on 15th cars frequently fail to stop at this stop sign and put cyclists heading west at risk i almost get hit at this intersection every day the person making a right hand turn onto 13th often doesnt look when there is a pedestrian crossing in the rain its even worse when crossing washington the crosswalk signal goes green just as the cars from the freeway get green to turn left the drivers usually go through the red light on washington sw although peds have the green to walk i am both biker and pedestrian bike path disappears across pennsylvania meaning that drivers infringe on cyclist space put cyclists at risk cyclists often use the bike lane on 15th st along meridian hill park in the wrong direction southbound need to extend the bidirectional bikelane from v st to euclid the pedestrian signal across the rrb parking entrance is so often red even when traffic exiting the garage has a red light too that it encourages pedestrians to ignore it entirely buses parked here decrease visibility i dont like to bike next to the buses because they have a big blind spot and i almost got hit by a bus a few days agoso im forced to ride in the opposite flow lane or on the sidewalk which is too crowded bikers routinely fail to heed stop signs difficult to turn from northbound 7th st bike lanes onto westbound r st lanes because of need to cross 4 lanes of traffic could be solved with bike box on eastern side of intersection to allow cyclists to make a jughandle style turn double parking by taxis and buses on both sides of the street during morning and evening commute times make it into a onelane street delivery vans routinely double park on 17th between u and p streets between 5 7 pm you will often find up to 4 ups trucks double parking on both sides of the road and swapping parcels between them almost all traffic take a right at this intersection with most cars cutting bikers off as they continue on the bike path 3way stop intersection there use to be stop signs for each direction but after the reconstruction of first st ne ddot has not replaced the stop sign at the intersection for cars going north on first street there is a yield sign on beach drive to turn slight right onto piney branch drivers often dont see it and more often dont yield driving southbound on beach dr and turning left onto piney branch can get real dicey with oncoming nonyielders cyclists consistently fail to stop at the stop sign here they speed through without even pretending to notice pedestrians cars fail to yield to cyclists who are existing the m st cycle track and merging with car traffic some cars disregard the pedestrian crosswalk visibility is impeded by parked cars on the west side of wisconsin avenue the number 96 bus drives too fast in both directions on massachusetts ave se between 15th and 17th sts se there is a very long leftturn arrow for westbound traffic pedestrians often try to cross during it because they dont want to miss their turn when eastbound cars are stopped on constitution westbound cars may still be coming its impossible to know when its safe to cross i would recommend closing prospect st nw and grace st nw to through traffic to limit speeding drivers often turn left from central lanes against signage and across through traffic in cycle lane im a pedestrian and a bicyclist the timing of the lights at this intersection makes it difficult for pedestrians to cross pennsylvania which is why they tend to cross halfway and wait in the bike lanes to cross the rest of the way poor visibility at this crosswalk means cars routinely dont yield to pedestrians because they are not visible this is the result of parked cars on the south side of grace st nw pedestrians need to press a button in order to cross and then only get 15 seconds to cross this busy intersection with no lights in the morning its always hectic here with the university shuttles and hospital traffic all bottlenecking the entrance cars are coming too fast to stop for pedestrians this stretch could use some trafficcalming nonsignalized crosswalks are almost always ignored by drivers cars fail to pass at a safe distance for bikers who are sharing the road given the line of parked cars on this portion of p st and the dangerous passing by cars bikers are put at serious risk of being doored or side swiped drivers fly down blair even though theyll have to stop again in the line of cars waiting at cedar or piney branch so they dont stop for pedestrians trucks and buses make illegal left hand turns at this light ie vehicles that are heading west on m st making illegal left hand turns to go south on wisconsin ave nw this is especially prevalent during the spring and summer with tour buses the crosswalk is set back out of sight from vehicles turning right off of cedar and onto blair also a lot of northbound cars run the red light and then theyre at this crosswalk when we have the walk light northbound cars run their light all the time which gets them trying to run down the pedestrians who are crossing blair on the north side of this intersection its impossible to know how a southbound bike should cross mass and continue on 7th its impossible to know when its safe to cross due to cars coming westbound even when eastbound stopped and then its not clear where to go to stay on 7th pedestrians often enter northside crosswalk while eastbound cars on l st have green left arrow during rush hour and other times too its nearly impossible to ride on the left of penn ave and then safely merge left to jump onto the l st bike lane it takes forever for this light to change to cross georgia its especially weird because so many of the other lights on georgia change too frequently to allow traffic movement traffic entering this block must switch lanes quickly to go straightleftright a bicycle lane would help protect cyclists and give them room it would also connect the numerous bike lanes in the surrounding feeder streets pedestrian walk sign on southwest corner of intersection has been angled away from street for months and is not visible the intersection at 13th and c st sw needs a 4way stop sign to allow pedestrians to enter the walkway drivers are failing to yeild to the pedestrians drivers turn right from west bound k st onto 19th st ie wrong way on oneway street often several times a day the nbsb lights should allow drivers to proceed across the ebwb lanes when safe with a flashing red a car with a green light going ebwb gets stuck in the median multiple cars back up clogging the passing lane and blocking the sidewalk sidewalk blocked due to construction at the h carl moultrie courthouse this sidewalk is very narrow and scary as the cars speed by rock creek park has become unwalkable now for pedestrians the cyclists are simply out of control they have prevailed and only they exist walk rcp at your own risk the roadway and sidewalks are both wide on this section of mass ave but one is dominated by pedestrians and the other by fast traffic theres lots of room to put in a bike lane particularly for uphill traffic metropolitan police department vehicles mpd double parked vehicles us marshals servicecourt security officer vehicles illegally parked in no parking area eliminate right turn lane and thus cause traffic to back up unnecessarily sidewalk is closed due to construction two steps up to walk way in john marshall plaza are an accessibility barrier poor visibility due to double and triple parking accessible parking spaces taken by law enforcement officer vehicles it takes a long time to cross the road here because walkers can never get a walk sign landscaping obscures visibiity cars driving on 9th st often fail to look for cars turning left after taking exit 4 from eastbound 395 there needs to be a clearer sign instructing cars in both lanes to look for cars turning left from the highway exit there is no safe place to ride a bike along here the sidewalk is too narrow and is needed by pedestrians the roadway is too narrow with no shoulder and traffic moves too fast there needs to be a better crosswalk here cars fly through here to get to blair the road is designed for highspeed but we only have sidewalks on one side we have a surprising amount of pedestrian activity and the nonsidewalk side is the most direct route for many of us very dangerou there is an extra wide midblock zebra crosswalk here but no curb cuts the driveway cit does not substitute for accessible curb cut excessive motor vehicle traffic speeds and poor redesign of street markings leave cyclists vunerable sidewalks often blocked by construction vehicles and poorly designed with utility poles in middle of sidewalk leave no safe alternative speeding cars at this much needed midblock crosswalk there are no good northsouth routes for cyclists between downtown and nw mass ave is wide and direct and should be reconfigured to accommodate a bike lane or cycletrack that would greatly improve cycle commuting between nw and downtown double parking by metropolitan police department owned vehicles and personally owned vehicles of mpd and other law enforcement officers this is the only road connecting georgetown to the cycle lane on new mexico but it is very narrow with cars parked both sides so cyclists have to take the lane which annoys the car traffic which has to crawl behind cyclists going uphill this is a dangerous intersection for walkerscyclists there are no crosswalks and there are two other intersections close by cars driving southwest on kansas go too fast and dont come to a complete stop or just erratic behavior as they navigate this light is super long to cross 11th the next intersection up spring is much more reasonable for each direction this one seems out of sync thank you for putting an uphill bike lane on new mexico ave it has greatly increased safety for cyclists on this stretch of road which is one of very few northsouth connector roads in nw pedestrian walkway is too narrow to allow cyclists to safely pass each other in opposite directions bumping handlebars could easily send a cyclist over the low guardrail and into automobile traffic confused drivers drive in the wrong direction on the streets that make up this confusing crossroads there is a very high need for pedestrians to cross between the north and south side of rhode island ave at this location and natural breaks in the light cycles make it completely possible but the lack of a signal markings is dangerous the sidewalk from 16th street ends here so pedestrians are forced to walk in north portal drive the street is narrow and at night it is dark motorists like to speed southbound on 16th street and turn onto north portal drive wo slowing down i have almost been hit numerous times by motorists who fail to stop before then turn mostly left at this intersection trucksdelivery vehicles routinely park in the bike lane here making safe passage impossible southbound bke lane disappears for this one block very dangerous to have to merge into traffic really difficult to take a right from the protected lstreet bike lane onto the protected 15th street bike lane difficult to cross 3 lanes of traffic and pedestrians get angry when you wait and use the ped signal people run the stop signs here frequently and speed far above the speed limit people are speeding so much on this block that they barely slow down for pedestrians much less stop construction has blocked off a road but drivers still are waiting for a red light that is not long enough traffic light should be disabled while va ave tunnel construction project has the road closed many kids and elderly people walk here and speeding is a major problem all down 14th street se the formal carved stone wall that crosses the grass and ends at the edge of the sidewalk makes it impossible for cyclists riding eastbound off the bridge to see oncoming pedestrians and cyclists eastbound cyclists reaching the end of the l street cycleway end up shunted into the center lanes of massachusetts avenue i walk my daughter to school through this intersection and although there are stop for pedestrians signs drivers never heed to them and we only have an occasional walking guard walk sign is turned away from crosswalk so walkers can not see when they are allowed to cross especially dangerous since there are two green lights one that allows cars to turn into the crosswalk and the other that allows walkers to cross there is no sidewalk here so pedestrians are forced to walk in the street due to hedges motorists turning onto tamarack street can not see the people walking in the street the crosswalk across north portal to the sidewalk entice people to walk here extremely fast drivers in a block with many kids and elderly please add a speed bump cars going south on 15th regularly try to cross the bike lane to turn right putting cyclists lives at risk or blocking the lane extraordinary amount of potholes in tarmac forces cyclists out into middle of road in an already crowded street cars do not seem to understand the need for bikes to avoid potholes the shortest safe connection between the roosevelt bridge walkway and the riverside trail directly beneath the bridge is 13 miles all the way around the kennedy center and the watergate cars traveling north on 4th street and turning right onto m street fail to yield to pedestrians crossing the road it would help to have a few seconds head start before the cars get a green light cars fail to pass at a safe distance especially during the uphill between porter and van ness protected cycletrack for connecticut and five travel lanes for cars seems more than equitable the asphalt on k st on the south side of mt vernon square is heavily damaged and makes controlling a bike difficult cars try to pass bicyclists when going on k st ne under the underpass and its very unsafe because the lanes are too narrow for cars to pass but they still try to anyways and ive been passed within inches and almost crashed bc of unsafe driving the light to cross m street during rush hour can take almost two minutes you want jaywalking this is how you get jaywalking delivery trucks constantly parked in left lane during no parking rush hour time in the mornings people cut through the gas station to go right onto porter street and also make uturns from southbound conn av onto porter street many pedestrians pass through the gas station to get to the crossing to quebec street i have been hit by cars twice people often do not stop for the red light at the crosswalk constant construction in the navy yard area crews are not allowing proper space for cars bikes and pedestrians sidewalks are blocked streets are narrowed streets are torn up and not fixed properly or in some instances not fixed at all too little time for seniors and people in general nobody ever stops at the right turn red light extend the cycle track all the way to constitution cyclists need to connect and there is not enough room on the sidewalk for both pedestrians and bicyclists no crossing lane to rec center even though there are lots of kids this is a frequent route for cyclists who bike straight down p st to or from the walkway at the southwest waterfront park east there should be a stop sign at 4th and p to prevent cars coming down 4th and speeding around the corner onto p st the valley trail crosses blagden road here there should be a cross walk marked on the road to improve safety in the morning parent taking child to maret shortcut i had right of way on crosswalk driver did not stop almost running me over actually i was run of the crosswalk needs a pedestrian crossing sign pedestrians cant see whether driver has a green light and right of way the place where the pathway enters the street is dangerous the ramp area is not sufficiently wide to accommodate this heavily used transition by bicyclists and pedestrians on weekends and holidays when beach drive is closed drivers fail to stop for pedestrians when turning off columbia onto euclid also construction on the church has blocked the whole sidewalk forcing pedestrians into the street these should be true modern roundabouts this should also be a true modern roundabout people run the light at least once a day no bike safety pedestrian in a wheel chair hit here because of poor visibility light is too short from crossing east side of porter from gas station to temple illegal left turns because sign is too small to see confusing lights the southwest portion of this intersection and continuing along oneida has no sidewalk making it dangerous to walk this intersection sees a lot of speeding from drivers using 5th to commute into the city for pedestrians its quite difficult to cross 5th because there is stop sign turning this into a 4way stop would improve safety for pedestrians and drivers during the afternoon rush when cars are not allowed to turn right from k st on to rock creek pkwy and must take the ramp up to the intersection with 27th they routinely block the crosswalk where 29th intersects k speed through this intersection drivers on sheridan often stop in the middle of the crosswalk here forcing pedestrians to walk into the road to cross this intersection should be a 4way stop some cars try to treat it like a 4way stop i have seen cars rear ended and side swiped at this intersection it would be safer if 12th g st se was a 4way stop cars rarely stop for pedestrians and it is a total guessing game and game of chance super dangerous almost every time i get to this intersection to cross the circle from outside to go into the circle at the crosswalk there are cars who illegally cut into the lane from the inner lanes in the circle even though they are restricted to going to mass crosswalk needed cars coming southbound turning left into porter to go down the hill consistently run the red light endangering pedestrians there is no curb cut for seniors those in wheelchairs or with strollers to cross van buren visibility is very low at this intersection and because those traveling on madison to not have a stop sign it is quite dangerous this would be safer intersection with a 4way stop drivers regularly block the crosswalk on the east and west sides of this intersection this intersection is dangerous and would benefit from a 4way stop sign to increase visibility and make sure that pedestrians including seniors and children can cross the intersection more easily commuters using north dakota to cut over to blair often race through this intersection making it unsafe for pedestrians the crosswalk is faded and poorly marked adding a 4way stop and zebra crosswalk would improve safety for seniors and children drivers using 3rd st to commute intoout of the city to avoid blair fly through this intersection it would be safer for pedestrians with a zebra painted crosswalk and highvisibility signs in the middle of the streetraised crosswalks cars especially md drivers do not stop for pedestrians at the intersection there is a crosswalk but no stop sign drivers often fly through this intersection without stopping making it unsafe for everyone there is a crosswalk on georgia here but drivers rarely stop for pedestrians its a very long stretch to cross especially if you can not run and very dangerous in the middle of speeding traffic drivers race through this section of kansas and the fact that there are two lanes with little traffic make it unsafe for anyone walking it would benefit from traffic calming the cars are going at least 50mph on east capitol the lights are wrong here they allow pedestrians and cars to go at the same time someone is going to be killed at this cornor drivers routinely speed on this stretch of piney branchsome traffic calming would help drivers often ignore no outlet signs along k st water st and speed down to the end of the road only to discover dead end they they turn around angry and speed back up the street endangering all other road users peds cyclists drivers this is a narrow street with lots of pedestrians and cars fly through it at dangerous speeds far above the speed limit cars do not respect the no right turn sign and turn quickly into bikes waiting at the light there is no sidewalk on the south side of chillum wide lanes here encourage speeding and failure to stop for pedestrians going westbound its hard to get to the bikeped side path thats on the eastbound side there is a missing sidewalk here cars speed out of mass ave underpass and almost hit bikes merging from thomas circle on to mass especially when cars want to turn right into 15th drivers speed way over the posted limit on this section of blair lanes could be narrowed to eliminate unsafe street widths across this stretch of blair this no safe place for pedestrians to crossno sidewalks the street is way too wide and commuters speed traffic calming bulbouts sidewalks and signaled intersections would make it safer cars speed by and pedistrians coming from metro have to wait for a break in traffic this is unacceptable for an intersection across from a metro station road is in poor condition potholes m eastbound drivers start this light has a pedestrian beg button and will only provide a walk signal if pushed there is no reason that the ped walk signal should not be activated always and by default there are 6 schools within a 3 block radius of this intersection there is no sidewalk here this intersection sees drivers racing through at unsafe speeds and would benefit from traffic calming and better visuals and markings drivers here on aspen regularly block the crosswalk drivers routinely speed the road can be narrowed to reduce unsafe speeds cars stop at the red light passed the line this forces bikes going from penn to 15 to make a right turn with diminished visibility cars are speeding coming from bridge r e commend speed hump lots of people cross here when they dont have a walk signal which makes it hard for cyclists to go through when there are no cars around it happens all day long the hill also makes it hard for cyclists to stop the other issue at this intersection besides the jaywalking is the red light running ive had at least three near misses while crossing on a walk signal one with a motorcyclist that ran a red light that was frighteningly close drivers turning north whether making a left or a right from mass ave do not yield to pedestrians cars blast up this stretch of sherman o st needs an eastwest bike lane bc narrow p st nw creates hazards for cyclists btw im a cyclist bicyclist or pedaler dont want to be confused with motorcycle bikers thank you narrow p st nw creates hazards for cyclists solution create a bike lane on o st nw connecting dunbar hs to giant and beyond btw im a cyclist bicyclist or pedaler dont want to be confused with motorcycle bikers thank you 7th st bike lane ends below n st many hazards created by cars competing with cyclists for one lane solution 6th st protected bike lane btw im a cyclist bicyclist or pedaler dont want to be confused with motorcycle bikers thank you cyclists use this bike lane bc there is no nearby southbound bike lane its safer against traffic than 6thst or njave with traffic flow solution create 6thstnwrt1 northsouth protected bike lanes from riave to pennave for alternate pedaler route there should be a connection between this neighborhood and the cap crescent trail the only current option is to cross canal street at the boat house which is incredibly dangerous lots of speeding here pedalers care about out pedestrian friends too this light often does not give walkers seniors with mobility challenges et al proper time to cross this busy thororughfare motorists regularly block this intersection during rush hour and other times solutions more traffic camera enforcementhigh fines ddot traffic guides like other busy downtown intersections to control traffic thank you 21st street between mass nw and penn nw really needs a bike lane why no northsouth bike lanes west of white house anc voted against it 10 years ago times change 21st is full of cyclists and only route downtown from upper nw hazardous thoroughfare with speeding motorists its unsafe for pedestrians local school children kennedy rec guests seniors at local churches et al a protected bike lane would calm traffic make route safer for all urgently needed thank you 49th street has become a commuting road alternative to foxhall and cars routinely drive 40 mph here and only slow down a bit for the stop signs when traveling on macarthur towards town the sign that warns drivers of a fire station comes after passing by the fire station it should be placed just after the exxon station lots of commercial activity here with people crossing the road randomly and often need a crosswalk at greenwich to focus the pedestrians and alert the drivers this and several places along macarthur could use one of those share the road biking signs drivers speed down kentucky ave southbound to race through the light and often run the red light drivers constantly fail to stop for pedestrians in the very wellmarked crosswalk long wait to cross blair on 4th st bike lane ends abruptly needs to connect to at 4th and 6th st impatient drivers are extremely reckless on this stretch of mass ave nascar track here on foxhall needs a crosswalk where the trail crosses foxhall it is a commonly used pathway often with dogs the sidewalk is narrow and leaves no margin for error for whatever reason maybe because parking is only allowed on one side of the street and its a big open road cars love to zoom through this block at racing speeds sometimes the vision zero plan should include the building of the new humane society facility here in a year or so it will create a lot of new traffic of all kinds for good reasons frequent light running as cars enter whitehurst from rock creek pkwy westbound cars on carroll st often dont stop for pedestrians at this crosswalk eastbound cars seem to stop more often this is perhaps because the westbound traffic is going down a slope traffic lights are confusing at this intersection because the roads intersect at weird angles traffic lights are confusing at this intersection because the roads intersect at weird angles so red light running happens bicycle riding on the sidewalk cars make illegal right turns from the middle lane onto vermont cars run this light to continue around cirlcle because they dont see it and traffic to their right has a green to turn on ri ave i have been honked at and nearly run down by cars thinking they have the green when pedestrians have a cross signal cyclists aggressively ride on the sidewalk in an area with heavy foot traffic and do not yield esp in front of trader joes cyclists scream southbound down the sidewalk expecting pedestrians to scatter like water bugs not enough time to cross at this light every day i see people with limited mobility wheelchairs canes walkers or crutches only make it halfway across the intersection before time runs out totally not acceptable confusing intersection with drivers from 3rd4th often turning against the light should be noturnonred bicycles on the crowded sidewalks usually going way too fast drivers often speeding north on 4th street to catch green light on florida construction eliminating sidewalks people accessing southbound vt ave bike lane wo going through logan cir must cut west on this short block which is one way east needs contraflow bike lane or something to connect to the rest of the grid and prevent salmoning or sidewalk riding cars make left turns onto 15th street from center lanes this whole intersection has poor visibility whether on bicycle or in a car coming down f toward tennessee it is nearly impossible to see if any cars are coming up on tennessee due to the angle of the intersection and parked cars cyclist came out of metro station carrying his bike up the escalator at about 9pm on a weeknight hopped on his bike rode wrong way on potomac and turned onto sidewalk going south on penn ave this is unusual behavior but still crazy cyclists frequently turn left on red lights into the underpass on the wrong side of the street i see confused drivers and pedestrians as bikers whiz by despite having a red light it is a very long light during the morning rush hour the cars going south are very aggressive in traffic and regularly run the light putting pedestrians at risk for cars going north many are speeding and go right through the red i have almost been hit about 6x in 15 cars do not stop at this stop sign very dangerous drivers need to learn that stopping is not optional here nights and weekends there are motorcyclists and some cars apparently holding drag races on the southeast boulevard note this map isnt showing all the southeast boulevard and needs to be updated this intersection has poor visibility for drivers cars turning north onto blair from cedar and other northbound cars on blair dont see pedestrians crossing until theyre too close the crosswalk is dimly marked and there are few cues for cars to slow down taking the turn from north adams mill to south adams mill many people esp families with kids cross here to get to the zoo and rcp the transition from the cycletrack on l to the bike lane on 11th is challenging and the leftlane sharrows arent really working its nearly impossible to navigate through this area when traveling from rock creek park trail to waterfront area impossible to cross and no wayfinding signage directing you i see many pedestrians and cyclists darting across northbound metrobuses continue straight in turn lane and then attempt to merge with no regard for cyclists additionally turning traffic regarding k street is a nightmare and routine southbound also feels dicey motorists fail to yield to pedestrians here motorists assume they are allowed to make a right on red here they are not however even if they dont make the turn they often block the crosswalk and prevent pedestrians from crossing safely motorists treat the red light as a yield sign here when turning right from 17th onto rhode island double parking happens every day sometimes on both sides of the street handicap with cane cars do not obey or see yellow signs at both crosswalks on se side of lincoln park we need stop sign or traffic light on that long stretch of 11th13th its very dangerous for kids adults strollersand dogs and every combine drivers are very aggressive here turning from ny ave on to 15th street ive had cars nearly run over my feet when theres 20 seconds left for my right to cross very dangerous for pedestrians here the sidewalk is very narrow and uneven i bike to and from work along pennsylvania avenue and two times in recent months ive narrowly avoided a collision with a driver making an illegal uturn on this block construction on the southern half of the western side of 20th here blocks safe pedestrian access to the sidewalk pedestrians are forced into the road cars speed through this intersection ignoring the pedestrian crossing curve radius is to big cars have no incentive to slow down and often do not stop for pedestrians in crosswalk speed limit is 15 when i drive that im terrified because other drivers tailgate honk horns gesture obscenely etc either increase the limit or ticket these jerks eliot hine middle school is located here with the rear of eastern high school cars speed down constitution even though it is labeled as a school zone please install speed bumps a guardrail is needed here to protect pedestrians from cars that speed around the bend here i have seen cars go up over the curb here the left lane is left turn only but very few follow this rule and continue straight cutting off those in the right lane cars never stop at this crosswalk unless you are extremely aggressive there needs to be better enforcement of crosswalk violations along this whole stretch people driving in from md speed down this stretch of 22nd instead of taking michigan ave a 4 way stop here would help as would speed humps the button to request a walk signal is several feet off the path and in the weeds when crossing the georgetown u driveway from the east unfair to peds really hard for bikes and wheelchairs cars make left turn from potomac onto 18th at excessive speed note angled telephone pole which angled because a car crashed into it at high speed it is indicative of how drivers drive at this intersection this crosswalk in front of my house is ridiculously long combined with cars making turns at excessive speed and poor visibility it is a death trap for pedestrians needs bulbouts and traffic calming cars like to speed up and down this hill and hate stopping for pedestrians crossing here drivers run the light at high speed from eastern onto the circle as late as 5 seconds after it turns red sometimes the buses even honk to announce that theyre going to do it this light is super long if you are on 20th going north or south drivers run the light on sd all the time a police truck even did it the other day then you only have 5 seconds to cross this block of ny ave is lawless double parking high speeds no bike facilities pathetic right where the bike path meets the ramp to the street the gravel is very loose and unsafe this may be a national parks issue but it should be inexpensive to fixjust need some hard packed clay the bike lane drops off there creating a dangerous merging area for bikes and cars bikers are forced to squeeze close to parked cars but many commuters are opening and closing doors during rush hour risk of getting doored bike lane shifts to curb but parking sign makes the bike lane a legal parking spot even with stripes cars are always parked in bike lane dangerous situation in traffic the busbike lane on 7th street is a joke drivers do not respect it and there is zero enforcement the road surface here is an embarrassment and also unsafe for cyclists who have to dodge potholes while car drivers are aggressively passing them and why are there no bike facilities on a 4 lane road there is a lack of sidewalks on the north side of most of pierce street cars frequently back up into the intersectioncrosswalk making this intersection dangerous to cross traffic usually caused cars to block the intersection making it difficult to cross lack of sidewalk on north side of street with uhaul truck bays it may be hard to notice pedestrians extra signage could help l street bike lane ends no shoulder on mass ave a tree sticks out right here on the sidewalk making it really hard to see pedestriansother bikers on the sidewalk but its less safe on the road although im a biker i often see cyclists blow thru red lights here and almost hit pedestrians it could use a more obvious sign to clearly communicate bikers need to yield to pedestrians heavy pedestrian traffic at this intersection cars frequently impatient and run stop sign through crosswalk full of pedestriansbikes stoplight might make pedestrian crossing easier 17th street is a disaster for any not in a car crosswalk is not painted missing for west side of this intersection across south carolina west of 14th street se here this oneway road goes from 4 lanes to 5 so that theres a right turn lane really 4 lanes isnt enough meanwhile no facilities for bikes on this street which becomes lawless as cars queue to turn right very busy intersection which can take a long time to cross most drivers are focused on the upcoming intersection and ignore pedestrians and crosswalks there is usually a lot of traffic here so drivers are also very impatient construction here makes it really hard to bike since you are funneled into on coming traffic signage here is terrible its confusing and none of the lights sync up so you are stuck in the media strip waiting 60 seconds for the light to change cars always always always turn left onto sb georgia from sb kansas despite big no left turn signs enforcement is needed as it creates a dangerous situation for bikers peds and other cars need more signage to alert drivers on patterson st about pedestrians on 1st st cars turning right and pedestriansbicyclists crossing have issues with yielding when going tofrom constitution fromto 17th the cars here dont stop for the light dont respect pedestrians in addition this light is too short i didnt know how to describe this because its a little of everything you cross to an island and then have to stop in the middle of the island to continue crossing sometimes there are a lot of pedestrians stuck there and then red light running the light here at the exit to the commerce dept often does not change to green for vehicles exiting the garage the 14th st light will turn yellow and then immediately green again with the side walk also blocked turn leftnorth dangerous for bike dc has a lot of islands where pedestrians are stranded at sea because they cross one lane or st and then get stuck on the island waiting to cross the other because of lousy light timing always look twice before crossing this street cars turn very quickly and frequently are not looking out for bicyclistspedestrians left turning cars rarely look for pedestriansbicyclists cars routinely roll this stop sign looking left for cars but neither direction for pedestrians dangerous its very uncomfortable to bike on 17th to independence and across the memorial bridge the alternative is usually crowded pedestrian areas on the national mall speed and no dedicated space make it uncomfortableunsafe the sidewalktrail on this bridge is way too narrow constant fear of falling into roadway or colliding with a pedestrianbiker passing cars turning east on l street from 23rd will run you over if youre crossing l street need to be a 4way stop can not see cross traffic when cars are parked along hayes cars come up the wrong way often to access the alley off 50th pl this alley between euclid and fairmont is used routinely by commuters and others as a way to avoid lights on 13th and as a way to circle for parking cars speeding through alley endanger alley residents peds and normal traffic on euclid and fairmon cars driving straight on north capitol frequently run the red light here cars block the intersection very frequently when the light changes and prevent bikes and cars to cross north capitol on r st this intersection needs a four way stop traffic on euclid especially east bound is way too fast a stop would create traffic calming and allow easier crosses for residents and cardozo students please install the traffic signal asap despite the bollards cars still speed through the dogleg from maryland onto eb d st there are no road markings on this stretch of piney branch and people frequently speed past one another to get to the left turn lane at blair rd nw people also often assume this road is a two lane street marthas table day care drop off and donation unloading constantly blocks bike lane day care in particular needs dedicate drop off lane that does not force bikers into traffic the light doesnt last long enough to safely cross connecticut on either side especially south side traffic going up this hill is generally too fast without a bike lane bikers are in grave danger bc hill slows us down need both a bike lane and better speed enforcement you cant get entirely across connecticut and end up in the median with cars whizzing by cars turn very fast into union station from mass ave and they dont yield to cyclists speedign on irving is the norm during am and pm rush this street should not be a two lane oneway east it is in a residential neighborhood with a school on the block it is not a highway for commuters make irving and columbia two way streets there is no crosswalk striping on east side of maryland ave although there is a crosswalk light traffic turnign right on to 11th rarely stops for the red light cars generally feel free to role right through on to 11th this endangers pedestrians and particularly children going to school this intersection needs a no right on red this intersection is dangerous not just for pedestrians but motorists as well there are vehicles coming from five different directions and there are frequent accidents need a stop sign or light the light to make a left turn from piney branch onto blair is extremely short only allowing for one or two vehicles to make the turn before the light changes as a result many people run the light having a longer left turn light would be safer people using dahlia as a shortcut to blair often run the stop sign please put some sort of traffic calming here so that people slow down as they approach this intersection it is extremely difficult to see on coming traffic as you approach apsen st from sandy spring rd please place a stop sign on aspen to make this road safer the northbound lanes on ga ave at the walmart are confusing to drivers some of whom often use the curb lane as a third driving lane or right turn lane please clarify the road markings here drivers turning left onto 14th street block traffic heading straight on arkansas please provide a dedicated turn lane or a left turn arrow at the light drivers turning left from n capital onto farragut are so eager to take advantage of breaks in traffic that they almost never notice whether there are pedestrians in the crosswalk new hampshire ave from sherman northwards is extremely hazardous for bikers with cars moving at a high rate of speed much too close for comfort for cyclists coming from sherman which is marked with sharrows there are few alternative routes north people often run this red light possibly because they are using 5th street as a shortcut to blair road please add some traffic calming to this section of 5th street possibly due to the walmart people cross in the middle of this stretch of road all the time which creates an unsafe environment for pedestrians bike riders and drivers during rush hour the left turn arrow for eastern ave often creates heavy southbound traffic please make the left turn light longer or provide a dedicated left turn lane from ga ave onto eastern ave the pavement in the southbound wisconsin ave right lane between newark and macomb is in very poor condition and dangerous for cyclists there is a wire coming from an electric pole that crosses the sidewalk on the west side of north capital at neck level this is on my childrens bike ride to school the first time my daughter rode this way she was nearly decapitated cars enter rock creek church road from north capital much too fast road conditions cracks potholes rubble make biking long stretches of 3rd and 5th profoundly hazardous this intersection is particularly bad new hampshire avenue needs a protected bike lane sidewalks in abysmal condition ludicrously narrow sidewalks on one side no sidewalks on the other side crazy fast street in between near a school drivers fail to yield to cyclists when entering circle why are there no bike lanes on this stretch of kansas ave cars frequently plow through this crosswalkstop sign without stopping cars turning from missouri onto kennedy street eastbound fail to yield to pedestrians in crosswalk difficult for bikers to move from multiuse trail to road drivers turning right from missouri onto north capital frequently come close to hitting pedestrians crossing legally in crosswalk there is no safe way to travel eastwest across rock creek park by bike sidewalk frequently blocked by cars from repair shop cars on missouri rarely yield to pedestrians trying to cross at 4th there is a tremendous amount of dog feces in this section of fort circle park drivers will crossing and turning onto kansas cant see bike lane huge potholes in bike lane at intersection with poor visibility bike lane vanishes area becomes congested during morning commute and drivers are hostile length of lights driver aggression make getting from one side of washington circle to the other long and dangerous its not clear to drivers turning north onto georgia that pedestrians have the right of way i frequently see drivers go through the red light here while pedestrians are in the crosswalk narrow sidewalks cars frequently block crosswalks andor fail to stop for pedestrians at this busy intersection cars will cut across the bikelane at almost every street coming off of thomas circle frequently without signaling street is narrow and cars frequently buzz bikes i have frequently encountered hostility from drivers trying to turn east onto pennsylvania ave from 15th st drivers fail to yield to pedestrians in this crosswalk particularly during the mornign commute commuters often block the crosswalk here or dont stop fully to allow pedestrians to cross this can be a difficult intersection particularly with children light needed to facilitate crossing monroe st roadway in dire need of repair ddot fails to respond to requests biking along rhode island avenue would be much easier and less threatening with a protected bike lane gap between 1st st cycletrack and pennsylvania avenue cycletrack narrow roads frequently busy drivers cutting to and from georgia do not stop at this stop sign making dangerous extremely difficult to pull into new hampshire ave going southinto quincy street going west coming from the east side of quincy street parked cars make it difficult to see oncoming traffic in either direction on new hampshire this park is a mess it is a health hazard and need more attention from the city the city council the mayors office and the park service it has a stench rats drug debris and trash this is a major issue i risk getting hit every day here cars turn right on red here frequently ignoring oncoming bike traffic mass ave needs a bike lane or better yet cycle track it is one of the most obvious safety and traffic reducing options available in the entire city there are elderly people who live in these apartments and walk to the cvs and safeway during rush hours this section of reservoir is like a race track unnecessary red lights cause people to treat them as a stop sign a poorly patched sidewalk hole near the se corner of 19th and q nw is a hazard speed bump too fast around curb 46th davenport intersection is common site for accidents nearmisses poor visibility stop for pedestrian signs lead to confusion over rightofway should be changed to clearly marked 4way stop this intersection has a lot of traffic at the am rush and a lot of walking school children from multiple nearby schools cars turning right on red nearly hit peds every morning the crossing guard suggested that we needed a no right on red sign there was a crosswalk at this intersection but it was removed why would the city remove a crosswalk at an intersection where are pedestrians supposed to cross the middle of the road there should be a line down the last block of montello ave ne to indicate cars turning left onto florida ave ne vs those turning right onto florida ave ne going straight onto 12th st ne or a slight right onto k st ne no sidewalk for pedestrians between p strose park and the trail along rock creek parkway this is a major access point for pedestrians and runners and it is unsafe sharp jog for westbound cars on ny is difficult to navigate even going less than speed limit so cars in left lane drift into the right lane theres plenty of room to straighten this out narrow the weirdly wide median or remove 12 parking spots taylor is a residential street with a lot of traffic through it from arkansas and piney branch making it a dangerous street to cross it should be a oneway towards arkansas to reduce the traffic through this residential street lots of bike traffic on this section of reservoir and lots of room for a bike lane the traffic light at foxhall and whitehaven should be timed differently during school traffic hours than it is during non school hoursdays it frequently stops traffic on foxhall for no reason bike lane drops out on this section of 14th causing cyclists to suddenly have to share the road with cars unexpectedly signals and walk signs dont seem to be syncing there should be a sidewalk here there are a lot of people who run and walk along this street a sidewalk will make it feel safer for people walking and running this corner has high bushes making it difficult for cars going north on 16th st that are turning right on to spring or ogden this is a dangerous street to cross for pedestrians for that reason a cross walk across 16th would also be useful here there is far too much speeding at this location particularly given its proximity to a playground a speed camera or other enforcement would be very helpful ive lived at this corner for 2 years and nobody stops or pedestrians including mpd there needs to be a stop sign or traffic light at this intersection lots of auto accidents speeding by cars and wmata buses to catch the green light at 17th and independence couple that with the failure of all cars to yield to pedestrians in the crosswalk and residents are in hgh danger of getting run over when trying to cross the street car turning right on red light from park road would not yield to pedestrian walking across 18th with the walk signal cars turning left from florida onto west virginia often do not yield to pedestrians who have the right of way in the cross walk also cars turning right from florida onto w v do not look for pedestrians in the cross walk very dangerous the button westbound for peds to activate the lights is broken not sure if this intersection really needs that feature but if it is there it should be functional no cross walk here very dangerous pedestrian corner with poor pedestrian access to piney branch park bike lane missing between florida and columbia rd causing unexpected mixing and an abrupt change of traffic pattern cars on florida ave often run the red light at this intersection i have been in the cross walk with my 17 seconds to cross and have been nearly hit by cars going in either direction as they run the red light there are three lanes northbound at this intersection only leftmost lane is supposed to turn left onto pennsylvania but cars in middle lane often make the left turn too need better placement of signs so visible to drivers while waiting at light 3rd st se from m st to virginia ave needs to be changed to one way northbound to improve safety and traffic flow and to reduce sideswipe damages to parked vehicles lanes should be configured and painted as on 4th street se oneway southbound the gap in the bike lane on 14th st nw from columbia rd to florida rd is a serious hazard to bikers many bikers take this road its what 16th st is for cars and buses a major route into the city very dangerous needs urgent attention intersection is not well marked stop signs are not particularly visible particularly northbound on 11th probably because of a big tree and the fact that the sign is far from the corner i think the stop sign for 11th street traffic is not needed bus drivers need better training to look for bikes before moving right for bus stop northbound bike lane would be helpful here allowing bikes to avoid the more dangerous stretch of 13th st to get btwn monroe and spring taxis often park illegally to drop off tourists who wish to visit the washington monument there is often short notice due to the curve in the road the curb cut to the virginia ave park was removed more than 2 years ago and needs to be replaced timing of lights at pm rush hour make it tough for a cyclist to get from this intersection and around park cars are trying to make the lights too and this makes it dangerous for cyclists no bike lines around this park need contraflow bike lane so bikes exiting the gallatin st bike lane do not need to turn onto nh ave or ride up the sidewalk where many people hang out there is plenty of room for a lane and it will visually shrink the road to prevent speeding no bicycle infrastructure this block of l st and yet it goes from 2 lanes to 4 why not take the extra lane and make it for bikes 4 lanes is not needed intersection of connecticut nb20 str st needs to be redesigned for peds indirect multistage crossing to continue along ct av confusing signal patternnb drivers going too fast turning onto 20th st would be great if there were some way to encourage the cemetery to create pedestrian connections here drivers stopped more often when the traffic sign was up would appreciate similar permanent signage the circulator buses pile up here and do not move making it impossible for cyclists to use the right lane since the bike lane on the rest of e does not otherwise connect with the lane around columbus circle i regularly see cars not stop for pedestrians at this intersection encouraging people to cross unsafely it would be much safer and easier for all to cross as a 4way stop the wait to cross florida can be over 2minutes and when it comes up it only gives you 7 seconds and cars seldom stop and frequently block crosswalk in heavy traffic drivers rarely stop for pedestrians in reno road crosswalks despite many signs cars traveling west on the southeast boulevard race across the intersection at 11th to beat the light cars get their first clear view of the light as top a small rise about 200 feet from it and then gun it scary intersection at 11th and penn has a short light and many cars making an acute right turn at peak times bikers have to go fast enough to get across but slow enough to stop for turning cars that cant see them dangerous the pedestrian signal for southbound westbound peds crossing mass ave is blocked by a sign move the sign back a couple of feet there is a light here but peds will start to cross when there is a blinking red hand that leaves no time for cars to turn either right from 7th heading north or left from 7th heading south the drivers grow impatient and try to slip between peds to go northsouth pedestrians have to cross l st to one island and then another island after ny ave and then finally get to the other side of l st they are given 17 seconds necessitating a wait at an island next to speeding cars hell cant cross ny ave from north sidewalk of h street without getting stuck on island inbetween inbound and outbound lanes second ped signal from island is very hard to see easy to step into ny ave without realizing inbound traffic still moving sidewalks too narrow and in abysmal condition difficult to see around stone wall north of the street have almost collided with cyclistspedestrians coming around the wall on several occasions drivers coming south on 4th are used to people running the stop sign on s carolina so they often stop even though they have the right of way risking being rear ended it would be better if this were a four way stop cars turning left cut the turn too sharply and drive over the bike lane there is no visibility as you come around the curve and cars coming from ga towards warder speed and move into the oncoming lane ive seen near headon collisions with both cars and bikes need speed bumps lane markers or conversion to oneway the curb cut is in a different location from the crosswalk so anyone with a stroller or a wheelchair or a bike for that matter has to wheel into the street above the crosswalk this intersection is atrocious high speeds westbound on c street lead to tbone auto accidents and repeated failure to yield to crossing pedestrians this should be much better marked andor be a 4way stop or some other calming please thanks this is the worst stretch of pennsylvania for cars speeding this is the section that they get to maximum speed many cyclists act as though they have rightofway when crossing 23rd st in the crosswalks despite having stop signs need clarification of who has row here drivers or cyclistspedestrians the light to cross 8th at e is only 15 seconds there is a lot of pedestrian traffic plus bus stops and it can take 23 cycles of the light to make it across the street can we have a bike contra flow lane on c st ne between 2nd and third it would allow bikes coming out of the capital grounds going west to safely access the bike lane on d st by turning left on third and then right on d ne avoiding ma this should be a twoway street from my office window i see about half a dozen cars a day go the wrong way down this street it is plenty wide for twoway traffic the lights at virginia ave nwnew hampshire ave nw last far too long for the amount of traffic at this intersection at least during rush hour they could probably be 1015 seconds shorter there is a large plant on the northeast corner of this intersection that makes it very difficult to see traffic moving west on i street there is some sort of electrical box on the northeast corner of this intersection that makes it hard to see cars if you want to cross at the crosswalk drivers turning from r onto 15th nw should not be permitted to turn right on red at least from 7a7pm the only way for them to see whether its safe to turn is to pull up and block the cross walk which they all do no bike facilities on constitution the excuse is that cyclists can go on the sidewalk on the south side which for some reason is considered a multi use trail but is clearly just a sidewalk there is plenty of space here for bikes vision zero extremely high speeds westbound on c street pose dangers to residents lots of red light running here makes this an extremely dangerous intersection for the many children who live on c street and walk through stanton park to get to the peabody and stuart hobson schools better marking the crosswalks would be a 1st step this entire intersection 7th and mass on through 8th is a real challenge westbound traffic on constitution often does not see or yield to pedestrians crossing south on 7th street and pedestrians cant see what the westbound light is doing cut through traffic with speeding and reckless drivers cars drive very fast on connecticut the cvs ramp to the second floor garage blocks a large part of the sidewalk forcing pedestrians very close to speeding wisc ave drivers intersection needs to be redesigned only a few cars can cross michigan and taylor at 13th going south for cars traveling north if a car is turning left then drivers get stuck in intersection after light has turned red intersection needs redesign now that hamilton is closed a lot more drivers are using galloway not enough time for pedestrians to cross and for drivers to turn either left or right from galloway to south dakota with construction going on lot more drivers on galloway bus drivers rarely stop for pedestrians drivers hit or miss difficult to navigate bike with bus drivers and car drivers and get to interim mbt route challenge to get to interim mbt route with bus drivers car drivers and pedestrians often cars will try to treat this part of 4th st ne like it is 2 lanes and drive in the bike lane especially if turning right onto h st ne cars typically parked in bike lane on southbound 4th here drivers frequently run this red light a protected bike lane on reno would be an amazing northsouth commuting corridor the middle turn lane could be removed and still leave room for a cycletrack and two car lanes challenge riding down south dakota ave to get to interim mbt route challenge riding on south dakota ave to get to interim mbt route cars or trucks often double park on this corner causing other vehicles to come into the bike lane drivers so not look before entering the bike lane i have nearly been hit several times in the am rush hour cars often do not stop for pedestrians in the crosswalk there used to be stop for pedestrian signs in the crosswalk but those got hit by cars and havent been replaced n cap st approaching fort drive turn only lane signage needs to start before coming around the corner to see the stop light people drive up to where the signs start and then have to get over and causes those who want to turn to have to wait delivery trucks double park on both sides of the road during the morning commute forces cars to maneuver around them making it dangerous for cyclists and other cars police cars often block the yield to pedestrians sign and as a result drivers rarely yield to pedestrians there is a confusing white line which encourages cars to merge into bikes without looking adding a bike lane thru the intersection would make this much safer lots of speeding along reservoir near georgetown and rock creek intersection needs to be redesigned not enough time to cross both taylor and michigan need sidewalk on east side of 1st place ne not clear why there hasnt been one all of these years long wait to cross south dakota at kennedy no safe way to get to the pa ave bike lanes from constitution cars get 2 lanes to turn right so a bicyclists would have to merge 2 lanes to the left which of course is suicidal given how people drive down this road challenge riding on riggs rd to get to interim mbt route drivers on 6th st ne repeatedly use the bike lane to park this is hazardous to bikers who have to merge with cars often there will be an empty space on 6th near the double parked car but the driver is too lazy to parallel park we need a crosswalk here many people walk through the plaza cross 9th street and walk down the north side of d street but theres no crosswalk this means that people are constantly jaywalking and cars are not yielding to them making this street oneway eastbound would discourage unsafe behavior such as rolling through the stop sign not enough time to cross 6th st at indiana usually only 16 or 21 seconds intersection needs to be redesigned drivers run red light because not given enough time to get through both taylor and michigan to continue straight on 13th bus drivers and car drivers often speed down galloway dangerous for pedestrians because only one sidewalk which is narrow from construction and only one crosswalk which needs to be repainted cars get a green arrow to turn on to c st from washington ave at the same time pedestrians get a cross signal cars do not yield to pedestrians in the crosswalk i have been nearly hit here this is basically a bus parking lot and there is no enforcement of bus idling eliminate this unnecessary uturn area give pedestrians more space to stand a mustang owner has created his own private parking space here by placing traffic cones in an illegal parking zone it is stripped as such but there is no enforcement drivers frequently fail to yield to pedestrians here a stop sign is solely needed because there is a school and children cross the street here this crosswalk is unsafe because drivers do not have good visibility drivers are particularly bad at making the semilegal eastbound right turn this street should become oneway northbound nj ave is too wide and encourages speeding there is plenty of room to add buffered bike lanes on both side because parking is illegal along this stretch pedestrians on the south side of this street dont have a direct route to cross towards md the light cycle is also long which encourages people to simply walk across nowhere to cross to get to grocery store for miles need crosswalks on eastern ave difficult to see traffic if trying to turn right or left with cars parked on street incredibly dangerous intersection layout is counterintuitive and the lights are poorly timed one of the worst places for carpedestrian interactions there are 56 lanes of traffic catered specifically to drivers that do not live in dc there has to be a cycletrack built here to dupont these are popular neighborhoods with many bikers that do not feel safe riding with aggressive conn ave drivers drivers coming off the e st expy rarely come to a complete stop when turning right onto penn if youre a ped walking northwest on va from 21 st drivers may not even look for you they only look to their left for cars on penn speeding and illegal uturns here cars fail to recognize the no left turn signs and hold up traffic as people incessantly blare their horns with realignment of union station half of the circle there are frequent backups here and the 2 left turn lanes that merge down to effectively 1 lane just past the light do not actually help consider reducing to 1 left turn lane cars coming out of the circle frequently fail to stop for pedestrians at this crosswalk and are often speeding too sight lines are poor due to parking too close to crosswalk elimination of 12 parking spaces on either side of crosswalk would help there is no pedestrian light on the sidewalk on the southwest side of massachusetts cars see a green light if coming from the alleyway downhill and wiz through and the pedestrian has no way of knowing have previously requested stop sign st 13th st ne and webster lots of speeding and ignoring the crosswalk visibilty issues make turning off webster dangerous as well thx the security barriers need short ramps to allow bikes to cut across the capitol complex and avoid riding on the sidewalk there is no reason for this street to have a 60 second plus wait time need crosswalk to get to shopping plaza there are 56 lanes of traffic catered specifically to drivers that do not live in dc there has to be a cycletrack built to downtown these are popular neighborhoods with many bikers that do not feel safe riding with aggressive conn ave drivers drivers come speeding from maryland and do not yield to pedestrians southbound traffic doesnt get very good visibility of peds coming from dahlia intersection because of the angle of the street and lighttolight driving encourages distraction cars at this 4way stop frequently fail to stop for pedestrians to cross especially during rush hours gate at cordozo always blocks sidewalk cars routinely ignore stop sign on westbound street in front of marriott courtyard i have personally witnessed this on a regular basis at least 3x per week lots of pedestrians bus riders cyclists and mobility impaired citizens at this intersection and cars that go as much as twice the speed limit of 25 needs a light stop sign or speed management device to allow for safe traffic management really narrow bottleneck with cars parked on both sides its difficult to get through this bit of intersection and when people are getting out of cars its also dangerous for them northbound cars on blair often dont realize the right lane is right turn only onto aspen until its a bit late to switch lanes for people accessing the park the light is unusually long you would never know cars have a stop sign from taylor st and frequently run it in front cua police drivers typically speed down eastern ave this is a steep hill and busy street a bike lane like on tildens hill would be much appreciated overly aggressive drivers from md constant near collisions with bikers and pedestrians speeding and red light running is prevalent through all of connecticut ave nw from dupont to bethesda westbound car traffic ion ri ave often spills back into the intersection oftendue to drivers running the red creating a hazard for cyclists peds and 15th st traffic need more enforcement here audible crosswalk signals for the blind say do not distinguish between eb and wb segments of mass ave even though signals are walk for only wb lanes to median for some of the cycle also no bumpy segments in center island when cars are trying to turn left here other cars swerve around them on the right side via bike lane thats already illegal but what makes it even more dangerous is that its at the bottom of the hill so bikers dont have enough time to react two issues 1 drivers regularly block the bike box at the se corner of lincoln park 2 md drivers in the far left lane of e capitol at the 13th st intersection try to beat the line of traffic before turning right to continue on e capitol as both a biker and a car driver its difficult to see whether there are cars coming on 11th st due to the hill parked cars and the cars stopped at the maryland light makes turning left from f dangerous this is one where people are going fast and turning during the very brief period when pedestrians get to cross and pedestrians tend to jaywalk here too im not sure if parking is allowed here from 46pm but often a car or several cars are parked on 17th ave nw during that time this forces erratic behavior from drivers and encourages bicyclists to use the sidewalk when north capital backs up usually during the school year drivers drive the wrong way on this one way street to get to alley to get around people use the metro drive as a through street speeding through and not stopping for pedestrians dangerous potholes quick shifts from highway to residential endangers pedestrians and cyclists important thoroughfare for biking but very scary because of high traffic and high car speeds scary place to bike critical node in city please make a designated lane here the timing of these lights and this intersection itself is simply confusing and crazy needs a traffic circle if enough room or a complete restructuring extremely dangerous during morning and evening rush hours cars on new hampshire block balir so when the light turns green to cross new hampshire the cars are bloked as well as pedestrians m street where recent repairs have been made is litered with dangerous potholes which if a biker is not prepared for send them hurtling towards the ground this occurs t worst between thomas circle and 15th street a bikelane to the north and south makes this a major artery but at times there is a sense of danger between cars and bikes need to make a bikelane here to connect all others dangerously high speeds feels like a highway despite being a neighborhood street i hope ddot realizes that they have just completely told cyclists to go die instead of trying to bike through scott circle a lawless land with absolutely no protection for cyclists by the way it also completely sucks to walk through here a man in a motorized wheelchair was driving westward in the eastbound road lane here because the sidewalks are so bad during peak hours bus commuters who alight here must wait very long before they can cross often dashing across the street usually with crazed va cars speeding up 23rd street the traffic signals are also confusing and hard to see for pedestrians trail is very dark at night and feels very unsafe afterdark nps needs to install better and more lighting dangerous with so many pedestrians coming out of union station drivers get so frustrated waiting at the stop sign they almost run people over i have witnessed this for 9 years a major problem on reno where the speed limit is 25mph cars not watching out for the bicyclists when turning park road is jogged at the intersection leading to cars not knowing what to do and cyclist and pedestrians being put in danger make the street one way or alter the course to resolve this issue signs wont help dangerous crossing area entire m street is full of bikers in the mornings and evenings its very dangerous because of lack of a cycletrack confusing and dangeorus to go north from water street and georgetown in general to rock creek park makes area really unfriendly and dangerous to pedestrians because people take uturns to compensate or out of desparation every time i come to this intersection and the next cars turn through the bike lane and nearly hit me or actually have hit me the brick sidewalk on both the north and south side of the road is too narrow for a wheelchair around the treeboxes further the roots have pushed up the bricks making it further unusable with a wheelchair vehicles often in a rush making the turn from 17th onto barney circle many often do not stop for pedestrians at the crossings here cars hurtling down n capitol ignoring crosswalks this whole junction is a nightmare for pedestrians but this is the worst spot cars coming in both directions along west virginia are driving fast often do not stop for pedestrians visibility is poor westward crossing w virg from s to n drivers often pull up in left turn lane then try to merge to continue straight through the intersection no pedestrian path on northside new development is coming to a parcel of the old soldiers home and this needs to be addressed impossible to see light leads to running of readlights from westbound traffic commuters taking left hand turns creates traffic jams every morning here no signs for water street on rock creek parkway southbound every time i come to this intersection and the next cars turn through the bike lane and nearly hit me or actually have hit me i have been thrown from my bike at hobart at least twice cars go at very excessive speeds in the south east direction from 18th to 17th to make the light at pennsylvania and 17th someone is going to flip a car or hit a pedestrian here vehicles on potomac ave routinely run the red light at kentucky ave both ebound and wbound pedestrian crosswalk does not correspond to actual pedestrian preference on where to cross many people run the stop sign at the corner of orleans place and 6th streets ne this happens in both directions take a look at this 18th st and ct side by side with no bike facilities on either its like ddot telling bikes go die this turn is simply not needed people can make lower speed turns at a right angle 20 feet down the road would be safer for pedestrians too why do car drivers need 2 ways to turn why must pedestrians cross two roads instead of one generally georgia avenue has people speeding without regard to pedestrians on this street south of metro and north of howard in park view and pleasant plains cars regularly veer into bikers dangerous driving threatens pedestrians and bikers by speeding through this very narrow streets turn try to walk west from n st here go ahead try ddot do you even care about pedestrians at all this part of n is one way westbound how should a cyclist go east from 14th and n thomas circle is a death wish and bikes cant turn east anyway logan circle is a long trip up north make this contraflow for bikes de facto already is for commuters driving into the city on potomac ave this is the only intersection without a light stop sign is easy to miss and the crosswalk isnt striped most cars roll through and few stop for foot traffic including my kids and me need stripes get rid of the beg button at this intersection why on earth should pedestrians have to press a button and potentially wait an extra light cycle stupid antipedestrian buttons must go the wait for people walking is both extremely long to wait for green and extremely short to cross the street crossing also has very disorienting signs for peds especially those related to the actuated buttons ddot needs to change the cycles here nb and sb cars fail to completely stop at the intersection need more enforcement of stop sign in both directions dangerous bus stop with no crosswalk or stop sign cars frequently parked at by the newseum during rush hour no standing parking times drivers frequently ignore the no parking stopping rush hour signs on this block crosswalk at grace and wisconsin was painted over it needs to be reinstalled need a crosswalk across water street at cecil need bike lanes on michigan age between taylor and north capitol st ne delivery trucks parked in bus stop which forces pedestrians in the street texting while driving is a huge problem everywhere in dc drives illegally turn left onto beach dr during the evening commute without regard to the sign telling them not to causing significant backups up tilden hill additional police presence and signage would likely help significantly dangerous intersection no traffic signal and cars on bladensburg go 40 mph limited sight lines too slow down these cars frequent stop sign running here failure to stop in this crosswalk trucks use this street as a through street illegally no through truck restrictions are in place cars speed down this stretch of hayes and often go the wrong way down a one way street its hard to see cars approaching on barnes street when eastbound on cassell cars often pull into opposing traffic to make turns and run lights cars often make illegal left turns on red many pedestrians jaywalking near crosswalks to bus stops others walk through green lights and block traffic no ramp here to crosswalk its blind alley people cant see drivers coming down cecil cars run red lights flex post are knocked down maybe people dont understand geometry traffic jumps lights and blocks bikers that must weave through cars to move on our green light intersection should be marked clearly and enforced why does ddot hate pedestrians they put a fence up here so pedestrians cant just walk straight up 16th i guess cars barreling down here to get to a few parking spots is more important eliminate the turn let pedestrians walk stop favoring cars many drivers heading south on 8th street ignore the stop sign at the intersection of 8th and buchanan street and vice versa a popular bus stop is at the intersection of decatur street and s dakota ave ne due to speeding traffic it is almost impossible to reach from the eastern side of s dakota ave when will the promised hawk system be installed failure to stop at this crosswalk crosswalk marked but difficult to see pedestrians coming around the corner there is 20 seconds to cross both sides of pennsylvania you have to run to make it across in one light not enough time to cross e capitol also the whole time you have to fight against cars because they have same short light bridge is not safe and poorly maintained many people will not use this bridge at night because they are afraid for personal safety cars moving at highway speeds on service drives very difficult for residents to exit neighborhood cars and busses on barnes sometimes fail to stop at intersection for pedestrians cars often run this stop sign mpd frequently posts an officer to catch stop sign runners but problem remains cars do not stop for pedestrians trying to use the pedestrian bridge people cross at this crosswalk regardless of its signal status often makes left turns from eb benning impossible pedestrians ignore this crosswalk light typically walk against signal when cars are trying to make right turn from dix st cars speeding on service drive at highway speeds make it difficult for people to use pedestrian bridge to deanwood metro station cars parked during rush hour and often double parked area around store has little room for maneuvering on a good day very hazardous when combined with jay walkers cars exit this driveway and go the wrong way down hayes timing on lights and volume of traffic make it very difficult for pedestrians to cross street many get stuck in the middle of the street or cross against the light cars often exit this driveway and go the wrong way on hayes make the turn onto anacostia ave cars speed down this street many come from the nearby apartments definitely see a lot of speeding here in front of the elementary school there are speed bumps but they are so low on the sides you can just drive near the curb without really slowing down illegal u turns here are terribly hazardous cars run this no left turn arrow all the time its scary as a biker bc they are not looking for bikers who come at different speeds than pedestrians i often have to almost stop even when i have a walk sign to be sure that nobody is running it the sidewalk here is so buckled that there are 45 inch gaps in the sidewalk it represents a huge trip hazard and would be impossible for handicap people to get down the street in addition there is no sidewalk on the north side of the street there is no crosswalk across suitland parkway i think that this might be entirely in md but it greatly affects dc peds going tofrom metro its so dangerous its absurd the light at the bottom of the eastbound exit ramp creates rushour problems cars often back up onto the highway also need a biggerlonger left turn lane onto northbound 11th st and enforcement of turn lanes visibility into and out of alleyway on east side here is very poor due to parking allowed too close to alley entrance please consider removing parking space to improve visibility i have had cars nearly run into me as i try to exit the alley here this block is oneway and clearly marked as such but every day cars drive the wrong way by accident some try to back up some just speed up and hope nobody is coming dangerous the crossing signal is only 25 seconds for a big intersection which often leaves cars no time to turn left after pedestrians clear the intersection some drivers do not understand that the road splits right onto i straight on potomac they get confused and run red lights stop in the intersection or swerve erratically pedestrians are completely invisible when that happens please add speed humps to 1st drivers are 1015mph over the speed limit next to a school the signal here prioritizes cars please turn the median lane on 7th into a turn only lane and lengthen pedestrian crossing time also the bike lane sucks which makes people on bikes choose the sidewalk protected cycle track would vastly improve commute to downtown and would probably reduce congestion i drive and walk around this area and observe a lot of unsafe speeding would be helpful to have some traffic calming especially at the intersections connecting the parkrec center to the neighborhoods the sidewalk on the east side of connecticut is too narrow having a car lane right next to it is also dangerous for pedestrians who sometimes have to walk there due to congestion on the sidewalk there area always a number of cars turning left quickly here and often disregard pedestrians trying to cross there is no sidewalk on this side of the street so you have to compete with cars to get to new hampshire from oglethorpe need some bike parking here near the coffee shop there is absolutely no enforcement of the bus and bike lane so drivers ignore it this is especially dangerous when biking and cars jump into it quickly when traffic is stopped or slow in the main vehicle lane one of the new restaurants on the north side in this block has valet parking in the curb lane yet they frequently fail to actually keep their vehicles in the curb lane they often jut out into traffic a great deal making the travel lanes dangerous sometimes 99 second wait time to cross after nats games especially that is an invitation to jaywalk bike lane going eb in this block of f st ne is in very poor condition with severly cracked and potholed pavement switch between asphalt and concrete that is also in poor repair and lots of gravel and small debris please repair people on g st dont know cross traffic does not stop how about some signs before someone gets tboned the wide intersection weird angle of potomac ave and big trees make it hard to see people and cars signs are also difficult to see especially am rush hour cars do not stop at this sign trying to beat the short light at 11th st get rid of the beg button to cross eastwest why does it even exist the light cycle is timed so why do pedestrian have to ask to have a walk signal obviously they walk anyway if cars in their direction have a green this is a college campus yet there are no bike facilities 21st has two lanes that regularly carry cars at 35mph redesigning one lane for a separated bicycle facility would make a safe space for cars at 25mph pedestrians and bikes both f and g streets have ample space for separated bicycle facilities there is otherwise no way to travel other than by car light to cross g st is ridiculously short and many cars try to turn left from both directions causing other cars and cyclists to swerve around sometimes in front of other turning drivers cars do not stop at this major intersection they roll through or speed through nearmisses happen everyday there are lots of mopedsscooters flying through too mindless of cars soupedup loud cars and motorcycles frequently gun it down k st like its a drag strip its unsafe and obnoxious instead of allowing on street parking near the corner why not make a leftturn lane since thats what most people are on i st to do in the mornings traffic can back up 2 blocks sometimes this is the major pedestrian crossing in foggy bottom yet drivers still have priority divers speed through and block the intersection please road diet this to 3 lanes to keep drivers predictable and add medians so people can cross safely thanks the corner of 14th and a st se is very dangerous moter vehicle traffic speeds down 14th st in hopes of making the green light not stopping or even caring about pedistrians 4 way stop sign should be installed protected cycle track on connecticut to dupont would be amazing would be nice to continue the bike lane from calvert all the way down 18th to link up to other bike lanes a protected bike lane on wisconsin would make ns commuting much easier to tenleytown and au park cycle track on wisconsin would make for a great ns commuting corridor there are plenty of car lanes protected bike lane on reservoir would improve access to georgetown hospital cut through traffic from 295 comes through neighborhood and drives erratically in this area the walk sign is only 25 seconds it takes about 20 seconds to walk across the street and you have to cross in front of aggressive righthand turn traffic protected bike lane on conn to downtown would make for a great ns commuting corridor give bikers a protected bike lane so they have safe commuting space this whole intersection is very confusing for all parties consider reconfiguring especially in light of recent pedestrian fatality here cars on kenilworth terrace do not always stop for pedestrians protected bike lane on conn to downtown please protected bike lane on mass ave would help bikers reduce congestion reduce pollution be great for all protected bike lane on wisconsin would help commuting patterns a lot a bike lane hopefully protected at least to calvert37th would help biking northsouth to au park cars speed down this stretch of one way street this block of kansas could use speed cameras people fly thru here on their way downtown unsafe cars speed down new york ave despite lots of pedestrian traffic the people turning right onto new york do not yield to pedestrians with a walk sign it is very dangerous and scary this is a major intersection next to a park and bus stop that is dangerous to cross with a bike car or on foot it invites speeding and refusal to yield because theres a hill and its a long stretch without a signal cab drivers coming and going from the hotel make u turns and three point turns in this intersection all day long which is dangerous and disruptive to pedestrians cyclists and other drivers signage telling drivers that there is a crosswalk here is inadequate or missing making it difficult for pedestrians to cross the street so many cars on their commute speed down this road during school drop offpick up there is no legal way to cross the street on this long block which is especially troubling during school pick updrop off vehicles double park here a lot cabs double park here a lot cabs make u turns and three point turns in front of this hotel a lot in order to avoid having to go out on to florida ave its dangerous i drive through this intersection twice daily on my way from mount rainier to my work on u street nw it is a dangerous intersection and needs a light or something to help control traffic coming both ways on eastern thank you the approaches to the sousa bridge need to be improved for bikes and pedestrians the sidewalks ramps and crosswalks are either in poor condition or nonexistent this is unsafe for bikespeds and discourages connectivity btwn e and w of the river timing of the lights at this intersection needs to be adjusted people are either running the northsouth light or blocking the eastwest intersections build a pedestrian bridge over michigan ave cars coming up from lincoln turn at high speed onto 2nd street and do not stop at cross walk this street is too narrow to provide parking on both sides and two way traffic often times only one car can fit at a time so there is a constant traffic jam here its difficult and dangerous there are numerous potholes on this street which makes driving hazardous and puts drivers as well as pedestrians potentially in harms way they also causes damage to cars remove the extra light at varnum and eastern waste big hole in the road in east bound lane left turn light is not long enough cars get stuck in the intersection re 100 block of franklin st excessive speeding going towards lincoln rd need traffic camera sidewalk lower half of 100 block of franklin trash debris high grass on sidewalk next to glenwood cemetery neeit is not safe to walk needs cleaning and 2ft grass needs to be cut did ask glenwood cemetery several times but still no response lights only change for cars and only give them about five seconds to cross cyclists then have to wait over two minutes for another light steps are not cleared after snow resulting in very slippery conditions and ice in winter cross at a designated light quit yer complaining cars do not stop at 4way stop and often speed if o street were kept as a nonthrough or changed to a oneway this would be a prime candidate for an ew separated bike path right now highschoolers and people in the neighborhood have no safe place to bike this intersection would be safer for pedestrians and easier to use for drivers if the sidewalks were extended to limit drivers from briefly using the third lane to cut off other drivers please look to new york avenue west of 9th street to fix major construction areas at 4th ri vehicles dont stop for pedestrians at the crosswalks speeding vehicles is another problem very dangerous furthermore the crosswalks need repainting need traffic camera this would be an excellent place to divert throughtraffic from 6th avenue on to nj prohibiting cars from traveling southbound with a diverter would create a neighborhood street like 5th this would make room for a southbound separated bike lane there should be a light at this very busy intersection i have witnessed a lot of almost accidents very unsafe for drivers and pedestrians especially with the bus stop so close love the planters that are here please make more of them elsewhere to limit commuters from using local streets for through traffic thank you cyclists fly over the new pedestrian bridge three times i have almost been hit by them when turning left to go down the stairs toward the mbt they should have to walk their bikes across the bridge there is no cross walk to get to the south side of the street to go by foot from the metro to the grocery store cars speed out of the parking lot making it very dangerous for pedestrians is always backed up when im in a rush during both rush hours there is not enough time to cross the street always backed up with traffic jams during rush hour in mornings and evenings need a marked bike path to cross sousa bridge in both directions cars also run lights red and yellow when in a rush as people are trying to wale across the streets people do not respect the signs and law enforcement are not doing anything to stop it very dangerous area for everyone always speeding up the street a lot of people jay walk which causes a lot of accidents near the area a lot of red light runners on buchanan people jaywalk and they have lack of supervision need to put crosswalk so people know where to cross a pedestrian crosswalk sign sometimes its hard to know when to cross crosswalk not by traffic light hard to cross too many cars turn at this point which causes long waiting need to trim trees and weeds on the freeway near sousa bridge there is no sign directing north bound traffic entering this intersection no yield sign no stop sign no stop light a driver coming north on lincoln rd might well assume they have the right of way and get tboned by traffic on franklinmichigan metro bus and several others have started using the right lane of southbound 1st street to turn left on michigan ave the street is not signed for this and has almost caused me to hit the illegal turners if i turn wide into the right lane rather th the road is always in terrible conditions causing people to swerve into oncoming traffic in order to avoid potholes this intersection is really dangerous for drivers at the stop sign who want to turn left toward lincoln mem very difficult to tell if cars coming the opposite way are staying on ohio drive or going toward whitehurst many close calls here trees and weeds need trimming traffic to turn left builds up and the wait is long drivers will then try to turn left from the right lane and cause dangerous road rage incidents including one i observed where a gun was pulled also panhandlers block traffic spit on vehicles cars turn right onto constitution from the two right lanes the second lane often cant see pedestrians the middle lane is supposed to be a bus lane i think there needs to be a stop light here so that persons turning onto franklin from lincoln arent having to fight everyone on franklin to get across now that the school is open on douglas it gets really busy at this intersection the pedestrian right of way is violated regularly especially by drivers traveling in either direction on 8th st and also by drivers coming east on c st particularly by drivers turning right from c st onto 8th st this is a one lane road heading south and people will squeeze into the bike lane just to make an illegal right turn on red regularly see drivers run this stop sign just saw another one yesterday with outofstate plates please consider adding a crosswalk to the middle of this block because of the distance between intersections there is frequent jaywalking across the street here making both pedestrians and drivers less safe several crosswalks in this area are not properly respected by drivers please consider camera enforcement or other enforcement mechanisms to alleviate speed camera here speed activated traffic signal only sidewalk on one side of street fire hydrant utility poles missing bicks vegetation encroaching ada noncompliant the bike lane heading east here is right inbetween lanes of traffic common for cars to occupy the bike lane and it doesnt feel safe to bike through here would be interesting to consider reconfiguring this design 23 carscycle run red trying to make l turns from eastern a modern roundabout would be preferable but dedicated l turn lanes from eastern are needed ive witnessed 2 crashes im sure thereve been others ped was struck recently very difficult to get onto eastern at this intx combination of speeding drivers and low sight lines due to parked cars makes it hazardous had walk signal but vehicle nearly hit me narrow sidewalk in underpass next to speeding traffic can lanes be narrowed to accommodate wider sidewalk contraflow bike lane or sharrows would be nice here as its a nicer way to get north by bike to lowell from downtown rather than going through the light at woodley and 34th narrow underpass sidewalk on south side of rhode island ave meets awkwardly at driveway ramp not an ada ramp for sidewalk possible tipping hazard for wheelchairs and strollers right next to speeding cars lots of peds cross here especially beforeafter church a crosswalk might make it less like a game of frogger cars speed down this street all the time we need speed humps east bound 13th street has a stop sign where 13th meets downing but no one stops and most dont slow down either south bound downing to 13th street or to the alley is missing a stop sign and needs one lanes are too wide speeding is endemic distance to cross riart 1 on md side is too far bulb outs on otis would help esp on se side to bring it closer to riart 1 additionally there are no crosswalk beaconscountdown clocks on md side of intxstill under ddot control ria ne signed 25 mph at this point drivers regularly exceed 40 on the downhill towards md to beat light at eastern 3 overly wide lanes encourage this dedicate 1 lane to buses andor narrow lanes to put in protected bike lanes signed bike route very popular with md commuters at folks looking to get into brookland it needs protection nothing to like about this intx modern roundabout development reconstruction not well thought out spend any time here and you see terrible behavior by drivers all day long cross walk curb cuts and lights are not on the same corners this feels very dangerous to cross rock creek church it would be safer to cross on norther corner because cars turning right onto harewood frequently do not stop when light is red got hit by car as a pedestrian desperately need a traffic light have been asking for years speeds regularly 35mph in a 25 mph zone sb towards bladensburg drivers gun it as soon as they pass speed cam no lane markings so it appears to be 1 very large lane still treated as 2 lanes by most stripe it bulb outs on e side of ria remove curbside lane or repurpose to bus only or protected bike lane reduce turn radius eb onto newton from ria dangerous to turn onto ria wb from newton bc ria 6 lanes remove gas station curb cuts no traffic controls between ri ave and varnum st so cars speed through this stretch of eastern ave 5way intersection has too much traffic with no control especially during rush hour a pedestrian and vehicle trip light is badly needed pedestrians need pedestrian countdown light at this intersection please please please install allway stop here driver never stop and it is terrifying motorists do not stop here at best they roll through at worst they go through at full speed without checking to see if there is other traffic or pedestrians this is true at every intersection on p st in georgetown this section of monroe has a bike lane that drivers often drive into usually to pass a car in front of them taking a left turn this bike lane should be protected from traffic view of intersection that needs to be a protected crosswalk httpsgooglmapsh2j11 please install speedbumps in alleys dirt bikes and atvs speed down alleys safety hazard for pedestrians especially young children cars illegally turn right from the middle lane makes crossing street very perilous its not a long way to cross but cars barreling down ny to get to m dont even slow down for pedestrians its extremely dangerous crosswalk desperately needed people jaywalk here constantly at least sometimes due to trucks pulling into the giant loading dock and blocking the sidewalk this needs to be a 4way stop buses heading south on 7th frequently take a right onto constitution ave here without looking for pedestrians almost run over a few times ive literally not seen one driver yield to pedestrians waiting to cross here many use wheelchairs yield compliance drops dramatically when more than 2 lanes each direction make ria 2 lanes each direction create bus lanesprotected bike infra repurpose sb l lane s of bladensburg into l turn only lane nb long backups leaving ft lincoln in r lane bc l lane is l turn only many use nb l lane to head straight anywayive seen very dangerous behavior here cars regularly speed mostly drive here its bad walking here a nightmare forget about biking was so disappointed to see a light go in here during reconstruction needs roundabout combined w roundabout at ria needs ped connection on s side to cross to home dep bad the pedestrian lights here do not have a countdown function this undoubtedly adds to the frequent jaywalking here frequent jaywalking across pennsylvania please install allway stop here so dangerous to cross here drivers never stop and drive way too fast need protected crosswalk witnessed numerous occasions were pedestrianscyclists were almost hit by cars turning right from 6100 southern avenue ne onto e capitol st ne fix this issue before the arrival of the e capitol urban farm and walmart there needs to be a four way stop at v st and 3rd st ne people are increasingly speeding on this street and with the poor visibility it is very dangerous for pedestrians and drivers rarely does someone stop at this intersection this was much better previously when there was an am crossing guard mf who helped children and adults get across the street safely the pedestrian signals to cross monroe st do not turn to walk unless you press the button there is zero dedicated space for cyclists which forces them between 45mph traffic and parked cars or onto the sidewalk please take a lane of pennsylvania for its entire length and dedicate a separated bike lane for cyclists cars pretty routinely speed up to intimidate pedestrians and keep them from crossing many of those pedestrians are children and senior citizens im honestly surprised something has not happened here yet it is a disaster waiting to happen can we put a four way stop sign here cars exiting 395 making a right on washington ave do not yield to pedestrians crossing the street i have also seen a biker hit by a car at this intersection the intersection of 5th and e street se south of marion park needs a 3way stop to make it safer for cars bikes and pedestrians there is very poor visibility for carsbikespeople crossing e legalize eb biking towards ria ne this portion of newton is 1way wb plenty of space for contraflow lane this is best connection to s portion of mt rainier and points e should be accompanied by protected bike lane on ria ne to eastern this is a fairly popular cycling route it needs protection at least for the uphill section heading wb from eastern its 1 way each direction very wide should be easy to add protection for drivers traveling east on new york there is no reason for a right turn on to north capitol m street serves this purpose many people are stuck on a tiny precarious island please extend the sidewalk to limit drivers choices and improve safety cars do not stop for pedestrians risky pedestrian crossing sometimes 20 plus cars will pass on eastern before one stops if one going north stops many times others will speed past on the outside of the stopped car frequently in the morning rush sunbelt rentals on 8th st moves large equipment up and down the street daily usually blocking an entire lane of traffic of drivers and bikers this welltraveled street is a terrible location for this type of industry enforce parking signs on sunday mornings cars park right up to the stop signs at the 4 way stop in violation of law difficult to see around cars when turning left people seem to rarely stop at this stop sign even in front of police cars going ns on 14th st routinely fail to stop for pedestrians walking in this crosswalk there is no stop light here but there is a crosswalk when southbound drivers on wisconsin get caught in traffic between o st and dumbarton they run the red light at dumbarton when traffic starts moving this is intimidating for pedestrians in the crosswalk with the light drivers almost always stop if there are pedestrians crossing 14th st despite green arrow light pedestrians should stop at curb separating most of 14th st from the right turn lane off park but dont notice that there are 2 stoplights to fully cross motorists harass cyclists who dare to use the car lanes typically honking shouting and passing too close aka teaching a lesson motorists harass cyclists who make a legal and signaled left turn here i do it all the time and the harassment can get downright scaryracistphysical there is a problem with the timing of the light here in the evenings the light turns red for north capitol but then turns immediately green again skipping giving green for hamilton street dangerous for cyclists and pedestrians please block off this median cars race to turn left from 61st ne onto e capitol st ne instead of turning right and making a uturn at 58th st ne danger for pedestrians httpsgooglmapsel2bf consistently when the light changes to red one or two cars will run the red light to head east on mass ave need a stop sign traffic is to fast on 7th street from franklin and 7th street to monroe st there is only one stop sign there is to much development and truck traffic not to have more stop signs the cycle on this light is incredibly short and coincides with people making rights on red from the giant parking lot exit it become extremely dangerous to cross vehicles park in crosswalk on east side e street se would be a good street for a bike lane connecting the washington ave se and 4th6th street se bike lanes the placement of traffic signals at this intersection is very problematic for pedestrians two legs have no ped signal at all and the vehicle signal isnt in a place where peds can easily see it and a third leg only has a ped signal in one dir not sure what ddot expects with this road design 4 lanes equals speeding and red light running switch this to 3 lanes please it is next to a park and school research and common sense has supported 4 to 3 lane conversions for a long time now bikes are forced onto the sidewalk because there is no other route this road design encourages speeding and red light running please divert traffic on to nj avenue and redesign this road with people in mind 3 lanes and separated bike lanes cars double park here a lot making it difficult to fit cars pedestrians kenilworth ave is extremely dangerous to for cyclists the sidewalk is to narrow to bike on and the road has no shoulder to bike on cars do not stop at crosswalk for pedestrians lots of pedestrian jaywalking in this area due to employment center apartments school metro the cross walk is very faded and cars do not stop for peds trying to cross minn ave plus their is only a cross walk on 1 side of the road which causes many plp to jaywalk or walk in street under the overpass cars and buses do not stop for pedestrians at the cross walks perhaps because the crosswalks need to be repainted there is a speed camera here which is needed and their is a speed limit posted for dc295 that says 50 mph it makes it look like the speed limit is 50 for kenilworth when really it is 25 causing cars to speed through area and causes speed trap the road regularly floods under the overpass cars and buses do not stop for this red light it is very dangerous to cross as a pedestrian most of the roads in the area have speed bumps except longfellow so people use it to cut through and go extremely fast 1744 d st has illegal 6 privacy fence in public space often complained to ddot and nothing done close calls when exiting alley fence blocks view fine the owner one of many illegal fences this morning around 815 am a dc public school bus followed by two other vehicles failed to yield the last one nearly hit me and screamed at me out the window kenelworth ave ne sidewalk is impassible its to narrow and cars are speeding by the lightposts make it so strollers and wheel chairs can pass without going out into the street very very dangerous benning road at the csx overpass is dangerous to both pedestrians and cyclists their is only a narrow protected sidewalk that does not allow for bikes to safely pass pedestrians bikes are forced to use the unprotected road in speeding traffic this intersections forces pedestrians to dive across multiple lanes of speeding traffic cars regularly do not stop for pedestrians in the cross walk people pulling out of the parking garage and apartment building are not able to pull out into minnesota ave due to high volume of traffic cars trying to pull into the garage off of minn ave cant pull in due to high traffic volume red light needed very dangerous intersection with cars speeding from every direction traffic calming or protected cross walk needed this block is one way westbound yet i am frequently confronted with drivers that ignore all the signs and drive east here i had 2 come at me on 730 at 10 am lots of cars atvs and dirt bikes speeding down this street dirt bikes and atvs speeding out of park onto 55th st no crosswalks between parking lots bus stops and other side of road minnesota ave ne needs more cross walks flooding please fix drainage httpsgooglmapstxrtr please

due to fences blocking sight lines intersection is not well marked too many speeding cars fail to yield right of way to other drivers dangerous at times drivers frequently speed along this section of 15th street cars speeding on fifth or coming off grant circle do not stop for pedestrians regardless of road marking and signage cars constantly pick up speed in both directions traveling along kansas between missouri and blair road traffic calming would help slow cars which are mostly not local traffic their needs to be a better cross walk here when bikes need to cross the kenelworth rd benning road merge cars do not stop when the red light cross walk signal is lite their is no sidewalk here people are forced to cross street with no crosswalk or walk in street to where the sidewalk picks back up again this is across street from a high school and on corner by bus stop sidewalk needed minnesota ave has no cross walks between benning road and grant street people who need to cross the

off the circle with no stop at intersection of 5th and webster 1200 block of emerson st needs to be paved st is very bad st needs to be paved badreally bad eastbound traffic turning left from the 700 blk of g st fails to yield to the westbound traffic turning right from the 600 blk of g st our block is a rushhour nightmare cars use our st to avoid the stop sign at f st the 1200 bl of e street has speed bumps but that doesnt distract cars from turning at 13th st onto e toward 12th st we cant even get into our cars or pull out commute through here every day and regularly see drivers fail to stop at this intersections its one im so careful about now having been almost hit several times even though there are three crosswalks with signs between crittenden and 3rd street drivers still fail to stop when pedestrians are crossing theres some sort of hole in the ground that a bike tire could fit into someones going to hit it someday and flip over their handlebars we need an am rush hour do not enter sign placed at this corner turning cars do not allow us to get into our cars especially those who are handcapped and on walkers this is a major ns route for cyclists because of aggressive speeding drivers and traffic backed up often cyclists are forced up onto the sidewalk please take out the parking lane and add a separated cycle path i often observe cars speeding in this area as well as they use 5th st nw to commute into the city its become dangerous i am both a driver and a pedestrian at this intersection and believe it needs some serious traffic calming to make it safer for everyone this intersection lacks curb ramps which is really problematic given that it is directly across from a school it would also benefit from better signage to slow down drivers and improve safety just observed 2 cars nearly hit each other here as one did not stop at the intersection and the other sped through at a dangerous speed drivers are encouraged to speed here because of the wide street vehicles turn right on red 18th street near perry street school is the location of frequent speedingreckless driving school children play on the corner while waiting for the bus while cars often speed by there should be a speed camera or other enforcement here cars often tear out of perry street onto 18th without stopping at the stop sign very dangerous need enforcement here this is right in front of a school temporary midblock crosswalk to accommodate sidewalk closure due to construction on west side of north part of this block is nowhere near ada compliant anyone using a wheelchair would likely be trapped here and have to go back around motorists often taxi drivers turn out blindly from bataan right onto rhode island terrifying as a cyclist since you can either get hit swerve and maybe get hit or slam breaks and go over the handlebars motorists drive too fast in the circle here and sometimes flip their cars over after smashing 89 other cars not a very safe thing to do cars headed nw on massachusetts ave speed to turn on g street assuming the pedestrians will simply get out of the way the distance to cross is to great the roads need to be narrowed to reduce driver speed southbound drivers on wisconsin ave often run this red light parents dropping off children at the school frequently block the bike lane in the morning some kind of signed drop off zone in the vehicle parking area might help cars southbound on florida often block this crosswalk difficult for drivers and cyclists exiting 8th st to merge onto piney branch cross traffic on piney branch does not have to stop no easy way for cyclists who want to make a right onto t st from the cycletrack to do so they are left to make their own way drivers consistently speed on this narrow residential street need traffic officers to ease am congestion 4 new charter schools 2 are large and sr day car at intersection plus usual heavy traffic makes this a nightmare every workday morning traffic northbound on connecticut routinely ignores the no turn on red command and attempts to turn east onto albemarle across path of pedestrians crossing from ne corner to se corner of albemarle connecticut southbound traffic on connecticut during weekday morning rush hour routinely blocks the crosswalk from nw corner to ne corner of connecticut windom place school kids get off the bus and cross the road here needs to be a crosswalk combined with traffic enforcement here before someone gets hit again crosswalks to cross 17th street at the north and south sides of n street are very dangerous pedestrians use them and walk in the crosswalk but cars on 17th rarely stop and just swerve around pedestrians instead of stopping due to the leftstraightright turn arrows here turning traffic turns from the center lane which is hazardous to bicyclists turning left or right from the bike lanes as vehicles should look for bikes and merge into the bike lane to make turns trucks often double parked in this block making deliveries to restaurants blocking the bike lane and part of traffic lane and forcing cyclists to weave out into traffic further enraging the drivers already annoyed by being slowed by double parking two stop signs many about 75 of drivers either go through without pausing or slow down and coast through also cars coming down from 16th street go too fast well above speed limit also also i routinely see drivers going the wrong way cars on s st often pull in to the crosswalk at speed or turn right on red without fully stopping a no turn on red sign might make this intersection safer vehicle traffic including metrobus often runs this light left turn arrow for cars exiting q st conflicts with walk signal for pedestrians crossing wisconsin these timing cycles should be separate the stop sign on the corner of 50th pl and hayes st was removed during the construction of the new 6d police station and it was never put back up so there is no stop sign at this intersection traffic eastbound on albemarle routinely ignores the no turn on red command at the intersection with connecticut and attempts to turn across path of pedestrians crossing from se corner to sw corner of connecticut albemarle use existing traffic study from riggs to north capital or develop one to expand riggs under overpass this is choke point for all traffic folks tend to speed thru this section of montana causing long waits to cross or turn from douglasdowning and saratoga this is the case walking biking or driving on the cross streets would be great to see stop signs on montana at these xs cars run red lights along h street after the turn from yellow to red cars make the turn from southbound 16th street to north portal drive at a high rate of speed not watching out for pedestrians crossing north portal the traffic lights at 19th pennsylvania are synced so that the crosswalk across 19th and across h st are timed together except that the h street crosswalk doesnt allow enough time to cross drivers speed through this area and are distracted its a route for families walking to school and should be made safer a pedestrian was hit by a driver in june 2015 the rough pavement along this stretch while tolerable for cars can be very dangerous to cyclists making a left turn onto eastern ave as a cyclist or driver is dangerous because oncoming traffic on piney branch is cresting a hill reducing visibility a left arrow signal might make this intersection safer cars park on both sides of s st making the travel lane very narrow during afternoon commute vehicle traffic often does not yield to cyclists 2 lanes going n now 1 at intersection due to bus stop remove stoptheres one at other end of block by riggs chillum pl in the past riggs floods by walmart need more drains on hills on 3rd and 2nd plus riggs to bridge left turn problem cars regularly drive through the cross hatched center lane in order to pass traffic and turn left on to 8th this is very dangerous for bikers and cars attempting to correctly use the lane and turn left on 8th southbound traffic on connecticut during weekday morning rush hour routinely blocks the crosswalk from nw corner to ne corner of connecticut veazey terrace cars traveling westbound on columbia often run the yellowred light which combined with the large width of the intersection puts fast moving cars at the west crosswalk while people are starting to walk better visibility signal changes would help cars roll through stop sign and intersection making it hard to cross car frequently speed along this stretch making it hazardous for bikers and pedestrians crossing nearby intersections there is no pedestrian light to cross madison drive during the morning rush hour cars perpetually block the intersection and crosswalk during the morning rush hour cars block the intersection and the crosswalk and aggressively speed up to clear the intersection even when the light has changed and pedestrians have the rightofway to cross 18th st world bank employees disregard the crosswalk signs and begin to enter the intersection with only a few seconds to spare cars in the righthand service lane turning onto connecticut ave nw always block the crosswalk or enter the intersection and clear the crosswalk right as the light is turning red and the pedestrian crosswalk signal begins at several pedestrian crossings in this section of 16th street cars never yield for pedestrians the only chance to cross safely is to find the few crossings with traffic lights the intersection of 17th and a se is treacherous the city has ruled out a stop sign and stop light as a means to prevent accidents which at frequent as a substitute request a lower posted speed limit as well as speed camera to ticket speeding the cars go incredibly fast on the upper reaches of new hampshire cutting the road down to one lane or adding a bike lane would make it much safer for bikers and pedestrians some cars stop for bikers and pedestrians here many do not road is deteriorated sidewalk damaged at railroad crossing nonada curb cuts curb ramp directs into moving traffic nit into crosswalk nonada compliant curb ramps drivers facing the circle still see a yield sign that predates the new traffic lights the sign should be removed i believe the intention is to have cars enter the circle on green light only need a crosswalk for community here this would also slow the traffic down for which much speeding takes place on 9th street parked cars on both east west sides of 17th limit visibility for cars turning onto or crossing 17th street the cars come off new hampshire with a head of steam and dont slow down until they reach the stop sign at 3rd st speed humps would make the street much safer turning onto kennedy st from kansas ave is extremely difficult to do safely this intersection is a mess these buildings and others along the mbt appear to be abandoned or very underutilized redeveloping them would improve safety on the trail and increase ridership no curb cut at crosswalk cars exiting 295 do not stop for pedestrians all crossings in this area are dangerous need mpd enforcement curb ramps are not adacompliant at most crossings at penn and sousa and penn up through minnesota ave a disability rights org is preparing a lawsuit nonada compliant curb ramp cars routinely use alleys parallel 12th street to avoid lights creating dangerous conditions for pedestrians near school and comm center poor visibility on upshur to drive across 12th forcing cars to speed through crosswalk 4 way stop needed cars speeding on michigan will create dangerous conditions for children at new school needs light cyclists ride fast on narrow sidewalk needs bike lane metrobuses and hospital shuttles do not yield to pedestrians near metro cars fly down this street entering and exiting hospital street needs to be one way dangerous intersection frequent stop sign running during rush hour cars dont look to turn right onto 21st from va needs a no turn on red sign drivers fly down potomac ave and rarely stop for pedestrians 18th and potomac is such a dangerous intersection no sidewalk on western side of street makes it dangerous to access homes on west side of street when parking on fern place numerous vehicles do not come to a complete stop when turning right onto south dakota from taylor this is a significant hazard for pedestrians vehicular speeding in and outbound on michigan is a big problem need speed cameras in both directions this intersection is a complete clusterf needs to be completely redesigned and rebuilt a rotarytraffic circle should be explored new traffic pattern is not clear resulting in far left lane drivers being cut off when lanes swerve to the right this will cause accidents if not addressed probably already have the dash line needs to be made into a solid line need signs biking is terrible on all of pennsylvania ave se driving is terrible and its impossible to cross in one light cycles at most intersections theres so much space and sparsely used parking theres need to be cyclist accommodation long hill that could use a bike climbing lane next connection to blandensburg is south dakota this gas station has too many curb cuts this walkway between the city municiple building and the dept of labor is awful it is falling apart floods in the rain and freezes over in the winter ive turned my ankle way too many times on a friday night a driver tried to run us off the road yelling out the passenger side window and swerving toward one of us as if to try to smash the person with the side of her suv bike stolen here was parked right outside el chucho during happy hour when it happened need additional stop sign at entry to 5200 block of 4th st nw traveling northbound from intersection crossing kansas av hamilton st and 4th st all along this fast 2 lane road cars speed and do not yield for bikers i almost got run over and yelled out by crazy drivers this road needs to have speed bumps be more narrow and a safer walkable and bikeable throughway between neighborhoods the right turn onto quincy st from rock creek church rd is too gradual encouraging vehicles especially buses to speed down rock creek church rd and not slow down for the turn a curb extension forcing cars to make a sharper turn would help a very large manhole has been haphazardly covered by a piece of wood that is now rotting seems like it will fall through as a pedestrian crosses it any day now especially on this very busy corner so much speeding at this set of intersections cars speed down park pl nw kenyon st nw and irving st nw this has resulted in multiple car accidents in the past year speed humps and single lanes should be installed only a 25mph lots of speeding to make light at kenyon st nw makes biking unsafe make one lane and add 2 lane cycle track along the park speed humps would also help vehicular speeding is a problem vehicular speeding southbound on south dakota this is a particular problem by drivers trying to beat the light at taylor resulting in accidents at that intersection cars leaving the safeway parking making a right north on wisconsin fail to stop for pedestrians there is a sign for right turn on green only but drivers fail to seeobey that outting pdedestrians crossing wisconsin at risk drivers runnig stop sign usually north to south sometimes south to north parents picking up students from kipp regularly use the cycletrack as a waiting zone the bike lane only exists in the middle of the block it turns to sharrows before the intersections this creates areas of dangerous conflict the random and unannounced closures of the plaza by the ss causes some very unpleasant detours for bike commuters a cycletrack on the north side could be left open and help reduce pedbike conflict in general shuttle buses often park here and block the stop sign preventing drivers from seeing it they will then obliviously run right through the intersection there are no bike lanes anywhere around this intersection and its very treacherous to attempt to cross especially since the lights are so short and the turning lanes seem to confuse drivers so they do not follow them predictably drivers have poor visibility when crossing over warder on quebec this road should be a 4 way stop drivers do not look at pedestrians crossing as they are focused on finding an opening to cross warder extend the bike lane south of mass ave to penn ave carsbusesshuttles speed down this road cars coming off of irving st nw speed up to make the light before entering the residential neighborhood this is extremely unsafe for pedestrians bikers and cars coming down park pl nw speed bumps and a single lane would help tremendously cars regularly roll through this stop sign making it dangerous to cross the street here complete disregard of this stop sign by drivers failure to come to a complete stop pedestrian safety hazard vehicular speeding is a big problem outbound on michigan both sides of michigan on either side of the intersection with 14th need raised medians to enhance pedestrian safety and slow vehicular speeding on this dangerous curve people do not obey the no turn on red light also the light is not long enough to crosslots of kids here from the playground why do we have to push the button to get a walk signal not safe at all drivers turning left onto florida avenue from 16th street proceed as if they have a green arrow even after it has changed to a solid green light creating a danger to pedestrians who have the right of way please take a lane and extend the cycletrack north from 6th to mt olivet a lane is currently closed due to construction and traffic still moves through fine and 6th is one lane each way there are curb cuts that lead nowhere but the sidewalk business here uses the sidewalk for parking people zoom down irving and speed up to make the light it is very dangerous and speed bumps need to be in place and irving needs to be one lane for people to not think it is a race track people speed down park place thinking that it is a race track it is 25 mph but people do not respect this this should be turned into a one lane slow road convenient for pedestrians runners and bikers those are the priority not lawless drivers people double park even though spots are open on the street this light is confusing to drivers going east bound on florida ave nw drivers feel they can run the light by making a right onto new jersey avenues street nw ive nearly been hit by cars more than a dozen times as a biker this road is very inaccessible it would be great to have a separated bike lane here there is no bike lane and no room for cyclists to safely navigate this intersection buses especially speed around this bend is is very scary to cross quincy walking down park place at morning and afternoon rush hours cars queue in two lines occupying the bike lane on irving st between 17th st and mt pleasant st so much speeding down park pl nw only a 25mph but 2 wide lanes and no intersections encourages speeding cars trucks and motorcycles regularly speed one lane and speed humps please so unsafe the light at this intersection is really long so people and bikers end up jaywalkingrunning the red this is a somewhat scary street to bike on but there arent really other options to get to noma besides 1 st nw bikers end up on the sidewalk which is even more dangerous cars regularly park in the middle of the pedestrian detour around the construction at nblagden blocking access both for ablebodied as well as ada drivers treat this section of connecticut avenue just north of the washington hilton as if it is the indianapolis 500 they hit the gas at t street and try to out race each other as conn curves and narrows into 2 or 3 lanes very dangerous need sidewk n side 3300 blk fessenden sidewalk e side of 32nd bt ellicott and fess w on fess along curve to stop sign on w side of alley at br br trc add new crosswalk at fess at br br extend sidewalk on s side fess bt linnean32nd why not create a bike lane on albemarle extend it past the malaysian embassy along ddot row to brbranch with a stair case and ramp to walk bikes then create a safe lane from albesouth to pierce mill to safely walk and bike and access rcp no crosswalk on the south side of the intersection which given how long the light is can lead to long waits some jaywalking the pedestrian island in the middle of d street does not have any pedestrian slope on the north east side and the ramp on the south side is ten feet away from the crosswalk while i have not actually measured the speed of traffic is feels too fast suggest curb extensions as 12th st 13th st and midblock at the entrance to the alley columbus circle is bad for cyclists even with the bike lanes but this location is particularly bad since the bike lanes are often blocked by traffic the street should be zoned like the 1200 and 1300 block of v street there are too many non residents that steal valuable street parking from homeowners parking on good hope should be prohibited during certain hours parking on good hope during rush hour causes major traffic issues there is no room for bicyclist anywhere along martin luther king ave nowhere for cyclist to ride or pedestrians to walk drivers go too fast far beneath 35 fts flashing dw requirement pedestrians heading north must either jaywalk or wait for the light and be stranded on the island to wait for the next one theres got to be a better way when walking south on the east side of connecticut i have to wait at least 5 seconds after the walk sign appears to avoid being run down by redlightrunning left turners many cyclists seem oblivious to traffic signal on pennsylvania ave and blow through crosswalks when pedestrians are meant to have the right away the addition of traffic signals with a bike icon may help them to comprehend the law more cars and trucks are making a left from connecticut avenue into california st ive seen quite a few near misses recently they are ignoring the no turn sign perhaps there should be a sign indicating the clover leaf from columbia to california 32nd and albemarle gets very backed up and congested visibility is poor and parents rushing kids to nursery school makes for a dangerous combination east side of intersection should have stop sign and cross walk its hard to know what the logic of the crosswalk timing is here the signal says walk for only a small fraction of the time even though cars passing through are relatively rare mostly pedestrians seem to ignore it each of these intersections should have a 4 way stop sign it is confusing when 80 have stop signs and a few do not very dangerous hard to see southbound traffic if youre heading north on bb and want to turn left on brandywin terribly dangerous for both peds and cyclists need separate lane stop sign running on 81 in evening all along this section of connecticut cars suddenly turn onto streets and into driveways at high speeds and dont look to see if pedestrians are crossing there are many near misses while onstreet parking is allowed between the crosswalks at times the parking is vacant and motorists use the parking lane to bypass vehicles turning left onto 7th st se sometimes oblvious that cyclists are in the bike lanes the street is a pass through for maryland drivers coming to dc they use the street to avoid good hope road there is a school nearby and the drivers speed down v street all day its just a matter of time before someone gets hit by a speeding dri cars park on mlk during rush hour which clogs the street this leaves one lane each way for all drivers parking should be prohibited on mlk during certain hours very unsafe exit to get onto malcolm x ave very dangerous area for all humans open air drug park massive homeless and mentally ill population liquour store popeyes chicken and drug park make up this corner disgusting and dangerous a health and welfare failure drivers are going way too fast along this street drivers speed through this crosswalk ignoring the pedestrians trying to use it bent metal on storm drain sticking out and causing tripping pedestrians forced to cross into traffic between parked cars crossing should be moved to corner of 47th and east capitol st se this would enhance pesdestrian safety and add needed parking for residents of the 4600 block of east capitol se traffic speeds shifting from two lanes to three lanes at 47th to central ave break speed camera is needed speeds of 50mph routinely pedestrians crossing east capitol from minnesota through there is no cross walk no bike lanes on east capitol pedestrians and bikers forced into traffic lanes to access rfk cars forced to merge from three to two lanes without warning traffic slows at 46th st becuse of drivers shifting from the bus lane after crossing benning rd heading east on east capitol st se a dip in pavement needs repair directly in front of bus stop large trucks hit the dip at high speeds causing load noise and shaking foundation in the early morning hours bike lane crosses oncoming traffic which does not stop there should be a stop sign for north bound 41st street at chesapeake street visibility for bicyclists is compromised by the crest of the hill vulnerable population of children cross odd lane shift as vehicles cross from maryland into dc on wisconsin avenue drivers in south bound middle lane are cutoff by drivers in south bound right lane better paintmarking needed on road to show lane shift crosswalk missing there should be a crosswalk directly in front of the awning at 2000 pennsylvania avenue to make a true north cross ing to the the sidewalk on west bound pennsylvania pedestrians jaywalk here every day be crosswalk wrong place cars routinely speed pedestrian routinely cross behind shrimp boatbenning rd metro to buses not using cross walk no biking lanes along east capitol st cars routinely dont stop but roll through intersection raised intersection is needed to enough cars to stop vehicles traveling north from wisconsin onto 42nd do not stop for pedestrians in cross walk vulnerable population with children in park traffic calming measures should be places to force northbound traffic to slow bizarre intersection should be replaced with a simple four way stop like we have on van ness at 38th street current barricades appear to be designed to favor affluent people living north of military bring back the grid please install pedestrian crosswalks we need a sidewalk on the park side and pedestrian crosswalks we need a sidewalk the park side and pedestrian crosswalks very very few cars stop for pedestrians here at unsignaled crosswalk very dangerous few cars stop for pedestrians here at unsignaled crosswalk very dangerous no cars stop for pedestrians here at unsignaled crosswalk very dangerous this crosswalk is deadly people will die here if not fixed cars drive way too fast on rhode island intersection at branch ave se and u st se is a very difficult intersection for pedestrians to cross especially for those riding the 36 bus that stops here speeding cars poorly designedmarked crosswalk and trees block the view for all we need a crosswalk on the park side and pedestrian crosswalks we need a pedestrian crosswalk where the wesley heights trail crosses foxhall road at edmunds street this trail connects battery kemble and glover archbold park drivers do not yield to pedestrians at this crosswalk on new hampshire ave even when the flashing yellow light is used i basically have to walk in front of them and hope they see me drivers going east and turning north onto 12th street run the red light constantly almost hit by a school bus full of children the other day as driver ran the left turn lane light drivers coming out of the tunnel are speeding as they get into urban fabric need a speed camera to generate money or police officers to give some tickets remove stop sign on 28thhillcrest dr heading southbound this is an awkward intersection a de facto 3way stop where southbound traffic is required to stop northbound traffic from hillcrest dr is not its confusing to the side street drivers cars speed through the alley to cut from girard to fairmont or vice versa crosswalk need better markings for both pedestrians and car drivers also pedestrian walk signals are not timed correctly and some face the wrong direction can be a tough intersection to cross as 4 roads at odd angles are involved better crosswalk markings needed install a measure that will slow the car traffic so that pedestrians can safely cross the street install sidewalk several police officers refused to write tickets for illegally parked trucks cars turning onto rock creek church rd speed much faster than the 25mph especially when turning off of new hampshire ave nw northbound the turning angle is very moderate and does not require cars to slow down cars often turn right the wrong way into r street going in the exit essentially especially cops going to the embassies on the corner of r mass im a cyclistpedestrian my concern is 4th street between i and south capitol street sw there is to much truck traffic that makes it dangerous to cross amidon school is right there at i and 4th street we need better signage to prevent the tucks from making it dangerous i live near this intersection and see drivers running this stop sign frequently during rush hour 46 cars can be seen running red lights in one direction cars block crosswalk crazy lane shift whoever designed this and allowed it to be built should be fired extremely dangerous especially in rain and other bad visibility days there will be bad accidents here this intersection makes it easy for people driving cars to speed through the turn which creates a really scary environment for walking there is no pedestrian refuge in the middle of this crosswalk which cuts across 6 lanes of traffic oftentimes pedestriansjaywalkers get stuck in the middle with no protection from multidirectional traffic flows bikers heading south on 1st st ne have to switch from biking with traffic in the righthand lane to a leftside protected bike lane at this intersection this creates a situation where bikers may have to cross against oncoming traffic at rush hour i cross this intersection on the way to work and find that many times cars speed through the yellow or even just run the red light to cross georgia avenue i was almost hit by a car that sped through after my light to walk turned green cars speed east on q street turning left on nh at the argentinian embassy pedestrians must commit to crossing the street from west to east in front of the embassy while speeding cars are still out of sight behind them install sidewalks install sidewalk on west side of the street especially at the bus stop currently bus riders stand in grass there should be an option to include blocking the bike lane as well but i will use this the brand new bike lane on 1st street is already a parking spot for delivery trucks cars and motorbikes come racing down park pl some to catch the light others literally racing each other especially with motorbikes this should be one lane and have speed humps as there is now need for 2 lanes never enough traffic main avenue needs attention because of the wharf development it is difficult to cross to go to the fish market and the traffic that goes passed it does not pay attention it needs pedestrian strips and sings to slow the cars down please place a diverter here to limit traffic entering from florida ave if this block of r were a one way the cafe park and farmers market would have permanent room to expand r street could then have a dedicated bike lane cars drive too fast this intersection is designed to let people driving cars speed out of the city that creates a really dangerous environment for people walking the design needs to be fixed theres tons of room for a bike lane on independence but instead there is a lot of space for fast cars three lanes for cars seems like it encourages high speeds and makes it harder for pedestrians to cross or bicyclists to feel safe homeowner for 42 years on this block trucks over a certain weight are forbidden on this block because these beautiful houses are literally being shaken apart in recent years however this is not being enforced this is not local deliveries georgetown cab dc license plate h97228 blocked l st bike lane when informed he was blocking bike lane he told biker he didnt care biker took photo of car taxi driver then exited car photographed biker and told biker f you this is a very dangerous crossing for pedestrians also dangerous are cars turning right into the alley just south of corcoranit is hard to see pedestrians due to double parked trucks etc all of dupont circle is a pedestrians nightmare if pedestrians are consistently tempted to jaywalk that is an indication that the system isnt working right this is a general comment i dont bicycle but i support those who do why not devote a few streets exclusively to pedestrians and cyclists dcers walk or cycle while suburbanites speed past or over them and dont pay commuter taxes either both streets at this intersection have a good number of red light runners in all directions cars traveling around the nw quadrant of dupont circle frequently ignore lane markings and signals especially the traffic turning right from the inner circle onto massachusetts this is a general comment please see copenhagen in the downtown cars go over wide speed bumps that are really the sidewalkbicycle lanes so bicyclists and pedestrians dont have to break their stride but cars do cars regularly uturn at this spot making it dangerous for bikes obeying the laws in the bike lanes cars run the stop signs at this intersection traffic calming measures requested raised crosswalks would be ideal which would require motorist to stop cars use this street to avoid the lights on blair road nw and constantly speed down the street running the stop signs at the intersection would like do not enter signs to be posted for traffic control during morning evening rush hour time periods it is very difficult to make a left turn onto blair rd at this intersection when approaching from kansas ave in both directions cars do not stop the timing for pedestrians to cross from south side of mass ave to the middle island is too short drivers coming from the outside lanes of circle also have a green which is misunderstood as signal to ok veering onto mass seen lots of close calls stop signs on 7th st ne at morton place ne are frequently ignored by drivers the signs are not visible and there are no painted crosswalk markings on the roadway drivers ignore stop sign particularly when traveling south on 7th st ne poor visibility when turning from florida ave ne onto 7th st ne due to angle of the intersction which endangers pedestrians crossing 7th st ne at this location scott circle is terrible for pedestrians the lights are not timed for people walking and as a result you can wait multiple times trying to walk around the circle this leads to jaywalking taxis and delivery trucks often double park in the cycle lane even when there is an empty parking space available buses also dont pull fully into the curb lane when at the bus stop at ny and 9 and end up blocking the cycle lane i bike walk and drive this road it needs a bike lane from east capitol to mt vernon square this will protect bikers from cars and herd bikers into their space and away from driving lanes safer for everyone connect to 4th st bike lane this sidewalk island was ripped up for construction work months ago and was never rebuilt properly section of it are just dirt roadway needs to be resurfaced driving hazard crossing mass plenty of time to cross from north to middle but very short time from middle island to south side when there are lots of peds small island gets very crowded people jaywalk dont realize cars coming from inside circle lane fast cars frequently speed on 1100 block of 7th st ne ignoring posted school zone signs and stop sign at 7th and morton pl ne drivers frequently speed on the 1100 block of 7th st ne particularly when heading north toward a green light at florida ave ne ignoring or not seeing the stop sign at morton pl ne this is a school zone cars invade the cycle lane from before the light on 11th though the right turn lane onto i from both lanes biking on k to ny ave is difficult at mt vernon left turn is against traffic right turn to go around square requires crossing two lanes of busy traffic need a bike solution here school zone begin signs are up but no end school zone signs where is the end put up the end signs the 9th stwvl st intersection is a mess cars zoom down wv trying to make the light at fl peds trying to cross have limited visibility turning south on bike down 9th st from l includes crossing wv is a death wish due to vis and speeding cars love kent streets neat pavement paving is a cracked up broken down mess that makes biking over it difficult however can it be mended lots of jaywalking while cars try to turn onto mass ave from union station cars frequently turn from k onto w virginia without yielding to pedestrians no fl ave crosswalk at 10th street everyone crosses there anyway install some safety with a nice crosswalk hard to cross from d to rfk parking lot due to speeding cars and limited visibility due to curve the curbs along the south side of md dont all have curb cut outs forcing mobility impaired residents into the street curb cut outs needed for 17th street behind school having to retreat a block and then travel on the street due to one side of sidewalk not having the ramp down and a large curb why is this the only block in the neighborhood not zoned for zone 6 parking streets would be safer if this block didnt have to circle for parking every morning elsewise getting a ticket for parking in their own neighborhood making a contraflow bike lane on 10th between h and fl would be helpful keeping bikers off the pedestrian filled sidewalks and compliant with the oneway law the sidewalk has a very large drop due to concrete breakage it is impossible to navigate up ie toward fl the western sidewalk if you have a mobility impairmentare in a chair its a dangerous intersection with very limited visibility right across the street from an elementary school a stop sign for northbound tennessee ave traffic at f street is needed before someone is injured or killed 15th street has majestic large trees it is also lined with old loud very tall street lights creating dark shadows and lack of good visibility for vehicles and pedestrians at night better lower street lights will reduce crime improve safety sunken manhole cover causes traffic to drift into on coming lane drivers heading north on 18th often block the box for cars heading west backing up traffic on rhode island and m everyone runs through this stopsign kids are going to get run over coming home from school the sidewalks are not wide enough for a stroller or wheelchair on the south side of florida every sunday cars from out of state park illegally on 11th to go to church try block the crosswalks making it impossible to cross with a stroller and park in front of the fire hydrant drivers run through red lights and pedestrians jaywalk in dupont circle drivers also cross lanes and turn illegally because the circle is so confusing i have lived in dc my whole life and i still am confused when i drive around the circle cut through traffic with speeding cars and delivery trucks this street needs speed bumps cars run stop sign and do not stop for pedestrians one stop sign missing for a year now typical dc cars speed downhill and through the stop sign to make the light at h jaywalking terrible in this area md avenue needs bike lanes it is super dangerous to bike on this road with all the aggressive driving cars do not stop for pedestrians especially at chesapeake and reno connecticut needs a bike lane for biking commuters too dangerous to bike here without one this is a very dangerous intersection at 22nd l st and new hampshire nw now that the traffic pattern is twoway southbound vehicles on new hampshire routinely ignore prohibitions on a left turn onto l st pedestrians are confused by crosswalks jakwalking terrible all across h but very bad at 8th and around 10th bike lanes in terrible shape please repair crosswalk not well marked need bike lanes very dangerous to bike among aggressive drviversspeeders need to add bike lanes not sade to bike 3rd and rhode island is difficult to cross due to drivers failing to stop for pedestrians in the cross walk drivers turning from 4th st fail to yield to pedestrians crossing rhode island very dangerous frequent speeding on g street in both directions starting at 15th street until 14th street almost constant jaywalking across this block of p street in all directions many peds arent even looking and become hostile with drivers trying to navigate the congested block needs a midblock crosswalk or close the street to cars altogether i park in the last driveway on g street just before 15th street ne and my driveway is often blocked by people parking on the street even when not blocked i have terrible visibility of cars coming from either direction which are often speeding cars taking a left on 3rd to go north dont look or stop once they lose the green arrow they dont stop for pedestrians and bicyclists this intersection has more pedestrian traffic due to the new apartment building and giant grocery store cars using o street are often accelerating along o st after passing through stoplights a 4 way stop would make this area safer the construction at the corner of m and 11th has forced m st to be nearly a single lane along this short stretch its extremely dangerous as a person on a bike passing by all the construction vehicles and cars not yielding this road used to be closed to cars and ever since it reopened the people mostly dc employees drive and park as though they are trying to kill the kids walking to school the whole road should be closed during school entryexit times cars are going way too fast for a street where lots of kids live there is no reason for drivers to take a left on to n capitol please remove the turning lane and add a wide median to this entire intersection extend the sidewalks and finally make it a place that feels somewhat safe for people living here seconding the one below extremely long and unsynchronized walking signals make this intersection a nightmare not to mention the high speeds cars travel down mass ave making it extremely dangerous taxis drivers delivery trucks etc constantly block the l street cycle track at openings before left turns forcing people on bikes to weave into traffic to pass this is a road that connects a residential neighborhood to our neighborhood school and there are people throwing car doors into the bicycle lane every day i have seen 3 children on bicycles nearly get hit by the doors of cars parked in the bicycle cars fly down the division avenue hill as they enter the town center division foote at marvin gaye trail hub has uncontrolled speeding total disregard for crosswalk high pedestrian youth volume and adjacent schoolsplaygroundyouth center urgent need for longpromised curb extension vehicles turning left on columbia from adams mill calvert routinely run the noleftturn red arrow blasting through this heavily used crosswalk id suggest switching the current bike lane into a contraflow and add same direction sharrows coming up d street from oklahoma avenue avoiding c traffic you hit this stretch of one way forcing bikers to the sidewalk or to salmon up the street intersection is a disaster for both pedestrians and drivers the traffic turning left onto 19th have a left green arrow at the same time as the pedestrians have a walk signal result chaos always a lot of traffic here due to the doctors offices the left turn red light might was well not exist given how often it is run by multiple cars turing from mass westbound to e street two issues here 1 terrible quality of road surface means dodging potholes when biking 2 cycling northbound there are parked cars ahead so you have to merge into traffic lane in very limited space no crosswalk provided for pedestrians on west side of 3rd st concrete barriers erected due to volume of vehicle traffic terrible pedestrian environment ive tried every direction going through this intersection not one has decent visibility add to that speeding commuters coming down wv is it possible to close this section of wv to vehicle traffic as a calming measure cars speed down 4th when the light is green not looking for peds its especially dangerous since theres a school with kids often crossing there this would be a great place for a raised crosswalk to slow traffic cars and metrobuses heading north run the red light frequently intersection shape means pedestrians are often already in the crosswalk on north side i count to five before entering crosswalk because i have seenhad too many near misses this street could really use a bike lane it is a major connection point to the park and trails that many cyclists use to commute however it is a very stressful ride as you often wonder if you are going to get run over by a car as m street gets very busy with cars and the sidewalks are not only narrow but also crowded with people biking on m street can be very difficult for cyclists people on bikes are forced to be very close to parked cars that could swing their doors open as cars whiz by at high speeds to get through this dangerous merge and then drive in bike lane blocking cycle traffic the bicycle lane is blocked and not accessible the road is too rough to ride where it is open the junction of marvin gaye trail kenilworth park is undermined by the frightening crossing under csx295 overpass the sidewalk is too narrow there should be a railing bike lane separating from traffic signs lights are needed westbound cars turning left from euclid on to 16th routinely fail to yield to pedestrians in the crosswalk after the left green arrow has ended there is a battle of wills between pedestrians and scofflaw drivers every time the light changes the 18 sidewalk on the west side of 15th creates a hazard for people exiting the park as they go right into traffic before they can see anything this is exacerbated by the lack of a walk signal and enforcement of cars ignoring the stop line here this is a confusing highspeed intersection next to a large charter school cars turning left from douglas on to 2nd a normal path for pickup dropoff are forced to twice cross two lanes of speeding lincoln traffic need 4way stop for lincoln children trying to cross 2nd street have to run to avoid the speeding cars flying through this very long crosswalk speeding cars on 61st street do not stop for the critical crossing between the marvin gaye rec center and the gateway to the marvin gaye trail sharrows are placed too close to parked cars the safest place to ride in this section of f st is in the center of the lane markings should reflect that to ensure drivers know they need to change lanes to pass cyclists 20 seconds to get across both bits are not nearly enough ill barely make it and im a healthy able moderately quick walker signal timing is a very long cycle for e street nearly always far far longer than needed by actual vehicle traffic levels even at rush hours signal should be retimed drivers routinely run red light across 3rd street to reach the highway onramp there is no way for a cyclist to trigger a light signal change when riding southbound on 3rd st at some times of day light will only change when a vehicle is detected and bikes are too light to trigger it so light stays red pedestrian beg button is located in grass not accessible for cyclists or any pedestrians with mobility challenges also beg button is not needed light should provide walk phase every single time dont make us beg especially a problem since the speed limit is 25mph cars drive very fast here westbound drivers on virginia ave routinely speed here treating virginia ave as the start of the highway onramp north and southbound pedestrians have to wait forever to cross as signal strongly favors the virginia ave onramp movement should be more balanced there are a lot of cars atvs and motorcycles that speed through this street while children are outside playing northbound traffic on bladensburg get the right turn arrow before pedestrians crossing ny ave receive the walk signal cars continue turning at very high speeds after walk signal is on and can not see pedestrians in crossing danger for peds the turn to get on this bridge is very tight and often times difficult to make as a bicyclist especially when there are pedestrians or other bicyclists present even without other pedestrians or bikers this sidewalk has very little room for error as it is very narrow it feels quite dangerous the railing cramps you on one side and the other side has a high curb which makes dismounting difficult with cars constantly stopping on this road cars are forced to pull risky maneuvers which often have knock on effects for cyclists and make reading the traffic patterns on this street very difficult taxi illegal uturn some cyclist do not stop when the light is red road lacks lane markings under the highway bridge when drivingbiking northbound impossible to know if there is one or two lanes here needs clarity the intersection where l meets k and west virginia is really dangerous for pedestrians please consider additional stop signs cars dont stop for us because they are racing for the light this intersection is completely torn up by construction and very difficult to navigate by foot and bike there are also cars coming from so many different directions it can be confusing to understand the traffic patterns none of the pedestrians understand that their sidewalk is actually a bike lane even though it is very well marked maybe putting up some kind of cones would heighten awareness and make the area more biker friendly drivers turn right from the secondtoright lane rather than pulling into the far right lane before turning large curb radius also allows for turn at relatively high speed some cyclist do not yield to pedestrians already on the crosswalk coming down the hill here it can often be very difficult to see cars coming up from the park on davenport st which makes the intersection a little more dangerous given the never ending construction this street it is a terror for everyone that has to use it constantly squeezed and funneled different directions as a cyclist pedestrian and car makes for a lot of confusion and precarious situations most drivers run this stop sign on harvard and many fail to yield to peds and traffic turning from lanier i have never seen any enforcement for this issue even when police are present some cyclist do not stop when the light is red esp with green left arrow no sidewalks for pedestrians and children people walk run play skate ride bikes walk dogs rollarblade in the middle of the streets there is no sidewalk on this block only a substandard trail on the park side of the street so many issues with drivers blowing through this intersection and barely slowing even if the light is red it could really use raised sidewalks andor curb extensions if im driving along longfellow to he intersection with 5th street its very tough to see if cars are coming along 5th lots near accidents and accidents here should be a 3 way stop or at least have speed bumps on 5th st nw pedestrians coming up from dupont circle metro station cross the street against light when oncoming traffic has a green turn arrow pedestrians also routinely cross in the middle of the block westbound drivers regularly fail to stop at the stop sign signal cycle length is too long outside of rush hour long phase for connecticut traffic just encourages speeding and makes peds wait unnecessarily paved walkway from rose park doesnt align with eastwest xwalk across rcpp ramp widen xwalk to cover where people are actually walking when pedbikecar traffic is heavy along k stwater st eg weekend days all sense of order breaks down probably need to signalize this corridor looooong signal cycles prioritize penn ave vehicle traffic at the expense of people trying to cross the ave since 4th st is one way with a bike lane cars tend to double park in the bike lane up and down 4th st even if there is a space to park 100 feet or less from where they are double parked running the red lights and not yielding the right of way to approaching traffic no wheelchair ramp on recently installed sidewalk 6 lanes for cars no median no crossing signals for walkers no space for bikes 4 feet sidewalks 15mph speeding red light running next to a university for the deaf ddot the sidewalk suddenly ends and without ramp to the street no sidewalks on either side ofn the street multiple cars double parked outside of restaurants and nightclubs at all hours of the day this is a major route from rock creek park wise road and the crescent trail but there is no bike lane sharrow or signage for cyclists sidewalks are needed but absent theres no crosswalk here and drivers speed through to cut aroundavoid blair its very dangerous and unpleasant for pedestrians or those who are elderly or with small children this intersection is at the top of a hill with little visibility for drivers drivers speed by and nearly crash into cars and pedestrians at this intersection there is no turn on red yet cars routinely turn right on red many times without stopping first drivers eager to catch the green light at river road fail to stop at this stop sign this is a pedestrianheavy neighborhood full of children please mark the intersection with a better striped crosswalk and pedestrian crossing signs need better affirmative signage to indicate jughandle for eb traffic turning onto ct ave nb too many drivers make illegal left bc they dont understand walkway needs to be wider too narrow for the many people walking biking here cars often try to speed around cyclists to make a right turn on madison ive had cars pass within less than 3 feet and been nearly righthooked on several occasions bike lanes should extended completely along 3rd st nw between kansas and blair need sidewalk along the wb exit from rcpp to k st pedestrians walking south from rcpp over to k st have to go under the fwy bridge and back around along the eb k strcpp ramp cars line up at light on right side of road to pass cars that are turning left at the light this blocks cyclists from easily accessing the bike lane which begins on the north east side of the intersection need bikes lanes from georgia to 13th the bike lanes needed on 11th st between florida and t st the street is congested and sharing the road on this street is very unsafe impatient drivers zoom around cyclists ive also nearly been doored a few times remove parking if necessary the bike lane on g st is counter flow so cars crossing g st often fail to look for bikers because the cars on g st are going in the opposite direction drivers seem to think that stopping at this stop sign is optional it is not its a very busy fourway stop sign with a ton of pedestrians coming from the dupont circle south exit and the n street bus stop all drivers need to stop at this sign cars frequently run the light for the offramp leading to maine ave south they pay attention to the traffic coming southbound but ignore bikerspedestrians going northbound i have been hitwitnessed accidents on at least 10 occasions due to the construction barriers extending too far into the street i had a large truck come into the bike lane where i was riding and was within a few inches of hitting me parents frequently double park in the bike lane to drop off kids at the school forcing bikes into street in an area where cars can not pass them due to the island at makemie pl the lights are horribly timed pedestrians get 12 seconds to cross one busy section of mass ave then 60 seconds to cross the rarely busy 16th street offramp thank you for asking i lived in mt pleasant found it hazardous to walk to rock creek park esp with my baby carriages we need feds to take some land by eminent domain if necess or somehow put in sidewalks likely on the n side park rd im a biker driver and pedestrian cc circle needs some visionary pedestrianbiker overpasses or for cars going down ct to go under the circle as at dupont its hazardous and very much impedes pedestrians and bikers from getting to friendship if peds fail to push the button no walk sequence is offered for crossing wisconsin ave this is a ridiculous setup that benefits drivers at the expense of pedestrians particularly one block from a metro entrance kids walking to lafayette and all the walkers need a sidewalk on one side of 32 street cars park on both sides of the street pedestrians are invevitably in the way of traffic preserve old trees by having sidewalks farther away fr street thx all along 42nd st nw military to wisconsin drivers routinely roll thru stop signs lots of cut thru traffic speeding walking is dangerous the dumpster parked on the north side of the street completely blocks the view of cars turning from 14th street to k street cars cutting tofrom blairn capital speed through here making it unsafe for students and neighborhood residents cars and buses turning onto e st from mass ave regularly run red lights 510 seconds after its changed its often made worse by the buses that stack up on either side of the road pushing traffic into mass ave who then rush through the crosswalk cars rarely stop at this crosswalk for pedestrians its especially bad on game days and at night its poorly lit ive been clipped by a taxi walking back from a nationals game drivers not paying attention frequently run the red lights that are not at intersections sadly it is safer to jaywalk across 21st than wait for the light and deal with drivers turning left who dont yield the bike lane on d st ne would be much better if it was a contraflow lane like the ones on g st ne and i st ne a contrflow lane headed west and sharrows in the main lane heading east would allow cabi members to get tofrom the station more safely dangerous uturn across double line and into bike lane failure to yield to cyclist in lane intersection of wisconsin ellicott and 42nd st is a mess peds walking south on west side of street have to cross 3times to go one block get rid of the ridiculous slip road and make a normal safe intersection school and grocery store nearby kids ride bikes to dealwilson they ride on sidewalks bec cars drive too fast on nebraska my d was hit by a car not seriously injured when she was riding quickly downhill car emerged from alley blind visibility due to retaining walls walking to safeway this is always a difficult intersection because traffic on piney branch does not stop for pedestrians and the distance across the street is quite lone crossing this intersection for pedestrians can take several minutesthe lights are not coordinated and if youre on the wrong side of the street you often have to wait for an entire extra light signal to be able to cross this light takes an eternity to turn and then gives pedestrians about 10 seconds to get into the median let alone all the way across the trolly buses have a stop here but they are too wide to fit they often are parked and blocking part or all of the bike lane road diet please the cameras havent slowed traffic down and the crosswalks are like a game of frogger make it one lane in either direction with bike lanes bike lane ends drivers use right lane to try to pass slow moving vehicles in left lane cutting off cyclists delivery trucks constantly blocking bike box pedestrians constantly stepping out into street and bike land without looking bikes have to take left car lane from 10th headed wb during rush hour as two lanes of cars block bike path safest and cleanest route is taking the left hand car lane before swooping back onto eye street via 11th or just before the triange cars regularly speed very fast along i street particularly along this allresidential block to beat the green light at 11th no sidewalk exists for half block on aspen st nw between luzon ave nw and 14th pl nw rough terrain and parked cars often require pedestrians to walk in the travel lanes add cycle track here when the cycle track in front of the white house is closed bikers have nowhere to go but delve into the dangerous traffic going up 15th st have to cross multiple lanes when crossing ny ave in the ns direction on the w side of 4th st the pedestrian refugemedian is not handicap accessible pedestrians must stand unprotected in the street at a very dangerous intersections where cars are moving quickly drivers including metrobus drivers heading northsouth on 8th street regularly run the stop signs at this intersection at high speeds often while racing to catch the green light ahead heading southbound onto 395 this light is very long waitshort go 8010 sec so many cars to speed across the road and run the redyellow light to get into the tunnel further people in the 4th st straight only lane cut into the turn lane when going southbound on 4th st nw turning onto the tunnel entrance other drivers come up in the straight only lane like theyre going south onto 4th st then once in the intersection they unexpectedly cut left into the tunnel lane dangerous bike lane ends at 1st and m consider making counterflow westbound bike lane on m st cars pull out of parking lots and alleyways without looking for bikers get half way through and block the bike lane while waiting to turn 10 seconds to cross this circle is insufficient particularly for children and the elderly this intersection needs a crosswalk traffic on rhode island moves too fast and too many people walk from the south to florida ave for people not to have this basic protection long wait to cross georgia ave confusing intersection with roads branching off at different angles cars often run red light cars speed down road force bikers to extreme shoulder street often not cleaned and full of glass andor gravel shoulder full of gravel potholes and other hazards to bikers narrow shoulder cars speed past during rush hour in close proximity to bikers need to get nps to put sidewalks into rcp for access for pedestrians especially those pushing baby buggies or who cant jump a curb at a moments notice in the face of oncoming traffic ever tried to walk across the park on military hug those trees definitely need a bikewalk path closer to road for light in the evening as well as signs directing people to path its super treacherous for bikers on military drivers regularly park in the crosswalk on the south side of the bridge here while waiting to pick up people coming from union station please consider adding some flexiposts to stop them from doing so as it is dangerous to try to cross here cars block the crosswalk preventing pedestrianscyclist to cross safely or forcing them on constitution avenue cyclist use this since no safe entry from the penn ave bike lane to constitution signs also say to use crosswalk for turns there is only one turn lane from m to 23rd drivers regularly turn left out of the center lane their visibility of pedestrians are blocked by drivers correctly using the turn lane this crosswalk needs the large bright signage that tells drivers that they are legally required to stop for pedestrians in the crosswalk drivers move at high speed or choose not to yield library and metro across street with many kids in area cars frequently get backed up from the no turn on red onto 23rd drivers regularly stop right on the crosswalk sending people scattering among the cars to get across these are some of the most brief crosswalk signals that ive encountered in the city in such a high volume area no less car speed up the hill come into close proximity to bikers cars run stop sign or dont wait for bikers to cross when its the bikers turn cars often double parked and blocking bike lane need to work with nps to get a bike lane carved out on the west side of the street not enough room by the creek road is too narrow for cars and bikes to safely coexist and bikerpedestrian access from broad branch is a must for safety i was hit by a car on my bike while waiting at a red light on n street since there is no bike line i had pulled into the crosswalk to wait a car turned left and hit another car which in turn hit me speeds on 6th street are out of control cars begin illegally parking here from around 610pm taking up a travel lane during rush hour forcing cars and cyclists to dangerously merge back and forth bike lane on 21st could partially help with this dangerous midblock crossing we need fewer lanes to narrow the crossing protected bike lanes on wisconsin would make for safer bike riding 1200 block of emerson street is in horrible condition needs to be repaved also could be narrowed cars speed down this block consistent and constant stop sign running during the morning and evening rush hours especially drivers go the wrong way on this one way street that is designed to feed into benning road ne drivers out of md using alley parallel to benning road to avoid slow traffic during morning and evening rush hours fear and uncertainty brought on merging onto the side road leading onto kenilworth from benning road traffic moving at speeds 50 mph leaves kenilworth and crosses into traffic oftentimes moving at less than 10 mph merging into kenilworth yikes maryland drivers using alley to avoid slower moving traffic on benning road maryland drivers using the alley like a street to avoid slower moving traffic on benning road especially during rush hours abandoned vehicle with flat tires allowed to park for more than a year close to intersection there should be no turn on red signs here with the elementary school on the corner there should be a no turn on red sign here given the elementary school commuters rushing through the neighborhood frequently blow through these stop signs they would benefit from traffic calming the west side of maple here does not have a sidewalk delivery trucks and drivers regularly double park all along 11th walk signal on northeast corner has been by bustruck and is no longer visible for crossing drivers with maryland tags using the alley to avoid slow traffic on benning road commuters rushing through the neighborhood frequently blow through these stop signs would benefit from traffic calming this intersection has very little vehicular traffic and yet pedestrians have to wait for a long time to get walk signals and then miss the walk for the next crossing could remove cross buttons and narrow distance to make safer cars commuting in from the suburbs on blair speed through this area at unsafe speeds making dangerous for pedestrians no light for pedestrian crossing six lanes of speeding traffic very dangerous pedestrian crosswalk is suited between parked forcing pedestrians to enter into traffic with vehicles routinely exceeding the speed limit desperately in need of a speed camera in the mornings and evenings particularly on weekends there are many joggers in the bike lanes on east capitol theyre often running against traffic ive had a couple close calls on my bike i often see bicyclists on 15th north of massachusetts traveling south this is a northbound oneway street poor visibility exit from courthouse garage construction closed sidewalk pedestrians in the street bike lane on 1300 and 1400 blocks of pennsylvania ave needs zebra bumpers like the rest of the pennsylvania ave bike lane has theres no protection from uturning vehicles on these blocks no sidewalks no accessible sidewalks commuters rushing through the neighborhood frequently blow through these stop signs they would benefit from some traffic calming traffic speeds of 50mph there is a stop here on red sign while going west on maine here some drivers think that if they get past the sign before the light turns red it means it is ok to proceed illegally and dangerously through the intersection there is no cross walk to cross oklahoma avenue between c st ne and benning rd ne the river walk is inaccessible from our neighborhood biking on 18th st between m and new hampshire can be harrowing dillons commuter buses often try to pass bikers when there isnt room ive twice been run off the road by buses here car drivers are also unsafely aggressive here during rush hour double parking by law enforcement vehicles police cars double parking illegally parked vehicles owned by us marshals service and court security officers no sidewalks no accessible sidewalks red light running by vehicles southbound on 16th street turning right without stopping for red light onto north portal drive stop sign missing vdhicles turning from southbound second street onto westbound d street and from d street to second street routinely fail to yield to pedestrians no right on red from 7 am to 7 pm needed on nw corner of intersection bulb out or other calming bike lane is always closed because of poorly parked vehicles or fbi cones closing off bike lane constantly cars blocking the bike lane sidewalk ramp forces wheelchairs and strollers into traffic to cross two ramps that lead into perpendicular crosswalks needed traffic control needed on k st commuters use as a raceway in and out of city please do something vehicles run red lights basically with every change of lights while cycling in the center lane to go down to water st a car in the left lane traffic tried to aggressively push me out of my lane to change lanes rather than slowing down a bit to go behind me ive biked here many times ok but this was bad no right on red needed 7 am to 7 pm on third street vehicles routinely fail to yield to kids walking to school very dangerous intersection for pedestrians dedicated left turn arrow needed for vehicles westbound on north carilina avenue traffic calming needed in school zone too many idaho stops stop sign difficult to see many vehicles roll through intersection without stopping sharrows marking and traffic calming needed sidewalk ramp forces wheelchairs and strollers into traffic to cross two ramps that lead into crosswalks needed the crosswalk is unsafe to use most of the time because drivers are speeding down 17th st ne there is also a sign which sets the speed limit to 15 mph when the lights are flashing that hardly anyone honors speed humpsstop sign or light needed this is a deadly intersection something needs to be done bikes coming eastbound in the heavilytrafficked cycletrack who are continuing straight on m st and not turning onto the metro branch trail are forced to funnel with car traffic under the overpass or ride on the sidewalk driver honking at cyclist in left lane and passing multiple times within 3 feet lack of striping and change of road surface between the museums here is very difficult for cyclists cars do not stay in their unmarked lane and the bumpy surface always makes me feel like i could fall off my bike there is no bike path along this road it is extremely dangerous to ride a bike along this road drivers block the bkie lane speed bumps making biking more difficult think about creating cuts in speed bumps for cyclists drivers do not stop this is a deadly intersection on 731 i was nearly killed by a car while in the crosswalk the car in the right lane going westbound yielded and i started crossing but the car in the left westbound land did not and i had to leap backwards out of the way the parking lot exit for the harris teeter vida is poorly designed drivers cant tell if pedestrians are in the sidewalk until their car is in the sidewalk this will become more of a hazard as the neighborhood gets more crowded pedestrians frequently run the light at the intersection of dupont circle and the access to connecticut avenue motorists with the green arrow frequently have to wait for pedestrians to clear out of the way which backs up traffic quite a bit to cross k street on east side of 16th buses do not pull adequately into the stop area to loadunload passengers resulting in a significant backup of traffic on the access to connecticut ave from dupont circle pedestrians on q frequently run the light thus endangering themselves and slowing traffic on the connecticut avenue access cars headed south on 15th regularly block the crosswalk on north side of i street cars double parked block room for bikes supposedly a part of the mbt but unclear whether or not bikes are encouraged on wide sidwalk sidewalk usually full of pedestrians the capitol police does not allow bikers even congressional staff with ids to ride on the street here forcing bikers onto the sidewalk with lots of walking pedestrians most pedestrians are walking with headphones in and cant hear a bike coming cars turn right from two right lanes with the bike lane in the middle this is really dangerous the roadways on gallatin and hamilton are really really rough lots of potholes etc to the point of being dangerous especially when combined witht he fact that the roads are narrow and lots of parked cars shortcut from 16th to kalmia avoids the light at kalmia one block later by cutting down myrtle drivers bypass the light this way and speed down myrtle which is a narrow street parking only on one side segway tours frequently block the bike lanes here entire northbound lane of 3rd street from g to south carolina is in a state of disrepair navigating around the numerous potholes results in bikers having to swerve into traffic and also pay less attention to pedestrians cyclists are coming down the wrong way down a oneway street this is extremely dangerous pedestrians constantly cross against signals new jersey ave southbound at new york ave the light cycle is too short for the line of cars which encourages aggressive driving as soon as the light turns green there are several points between 14th19th st ne that cross massachusetts avenue ne where crosstraffic does not have to stop there should really be a stop sign to reduce the potential for car accidents cars are exiting parking garage making an illegal turn into one way traffic to use the alley as a cut through to avoid the traffic light they are speeding children live in the homes along this alley and they are in danger we need speed bumps car speed by bikers cutting them off at stop sign painting sharrows on road would help cars speed by bikers cut them off when approaching parked cars on side of road cars are constantly double parked here especially outside of target drivers in the left lane of the raised lanes in southbound north capitol frequently make a right turn onto ny ave the lane is marked left and straight only needs no right turn from this lane signage slows traffic makes people speed through reds drivers coming south on n capitol and turning left onto eastbound road island ave constantly run the second light ive seen accidents multiple times between cars running this light and those proceeding northbound on n capitol poor visibility when making a right turn north out of the alley when a vehicle is parked immediately to the left frequently a large white van in the northbound lane it is very difficult to see if a car is coming drivers who are turning left onto 15th street from eb constitution frequently run the red light and almost cause accidents with those going wb regarding no right on red sign westbound on u street turning north on 14th street the no right turn on red policy really puts pedestrians at risk and congests traffic cars only get more aggressive on turns during the short green light cycle when driving north on 3rd drivers proceeding straight through the intersection with maryland have to inch so far into the road to see any westbound maryland traffic that they are halfway into the eastbound lane im not sure what it is about this stoplight that pedestrians dont understand but i frequently see pedestrians walk through the intersection and almost get hit by cars making left turns with the green arrow this could probably apply for all of connecticut avenue but it appears that the electronic signs indicating when rush hour motorists should use 3 lanes instead of 4 are obscured by trees many motorists stay in the far left lane until military cars traveling eastbound on ny ave frequently make illegal left turns onto north capitol st nearly hitting pedestrians there is only a very small sign on the light pole the no left turn signage should be much more visible cars routinely block crosswalks at 18th and k because of the confusing traffic pattern here pedestrians often jaywalk crossing l st nw without recognizing that oncoming northbound traffic on new hampshire ave nw has a green light and may turn right onto l st nw drivers exiting the parking garage make an illegal hairpin turn to drive down the alley towards 3rd street they often come through at high speeds which are unsafe for the residents who traverse the alley many of whom are young children people often jaywalk here in the morning because the exit isnt highly used and the wait can be about a minute cars frequently do not stop at this intersection its at least 80 seconds wait to cross h st but it barely gives you 15 to get across its no wonder people give up and try to jaywalk when it feels like an eternity just to get across the block this area has rough and dangerous bike paths they need to be replaced a round utility hole cover in the rock creek bikeway between p and m streets has severe raised metal edges which could flip a bicycle it should be replaced with a normal utility hole cover this is a problem at many intersections in this neighborhood cars either do a rolling stop or none at all at times and totally ignore crosswalks more cars during games means it happens more but is worse when no games and ppl fly through there is no pedestrian signal crossing c street from the south to the north on the west side of the intersection cyclists are constantly running this light heading south on 11th during morning rush hour south and northbound traffic gets a long light 60 seconds or better where east or westbound you get 25 seconds to cross 5 lanes need enforcement at this intersection cyclists traveling south on florida have to switch from the right side of the street to the center bike line on florida between w and v a dedicated light for bikes would help people constantly jaywalk here to cross the street possibly frequently coming from the hotel need to add a safe way for people to cross here so they dont have to jaywalk almost always a circulator bus blocking the bike lanes in the afternoon instead of pulling into the stops they idle in the bike lanes to pull out easier two cars ran the same red light one eastbound one westbound 830 am 8142015 pedestrians jaywalk across the k street service lane at all times ignoring thru traffic from the service lane or traffic that may be merging from the main lane into the service lane at the intersection vehicles cars and trucks regularly park in the no parking zone blocking the crosswalk traffic lane and bike lane big hole in pavement in right lane f st wb immediately west of decorative xwalk very bad for bikes construction trucks are very often idling here in the morning many drivers proceed straight from the left turn only lanes circulator busses stand at the stop which blocks the bike lane the bus stop needs to be moved back so that cyclists do not have to be in the midle lane when circulators stand for more than 10 min metro busses have to go around them because these two blocks of kentucky ave are 1way cyclists heading south toward the anacostia trail are forced onto either onto 17th or pennsylvania neither is very good need to make road twoway or add a reverse flow bike lane doesnt seem clear to drivers that if they are traveling south on florida they can not make a sharp right onto 15th at this intersection ive had a handful of occasions when im traveling south on florida and cut off by a car turning on to 15th cross walk south of u between nh and 16th pedestrians arent aware of cyclist green light dont know when not to cross many near misses cyclists are rushing to make it during too short light need a pedestrian crossing here to link to neighborhood cars will frequently try to overtake on this small hill as cyclists are a bit slower going uphill the lane is too narrow for this to be safe and there is no advantage anyway for the drivers as they have to stop at the stop sign just ahead cars will often speed and try to overtake cyclists that are struggling up the hill for no reason as they have to stop at the light because of the frequent backup of cabs in the leftmost lane there is little room for a cyclist to let cars pass the turn lanes for eastbound traffic from michigan to monroe or thru on michigan is not marked making for poor driving the nb bike lane on wash ave sw deadends at the tjunction with independence ave sw cars from the 2 leftturn lanes drift to the right lane when they turn left and squeeze bikes out bike lane needs to have cheater lines marked thru the intersect motorcyclists and scooterriders ride in the bike lane they are the worst very dangerous speeding on wide laned oneway street next to rec center cyclists especially capital bikeshare cyclists often bike the wrong way down this street because there is no other way to get to stadiumarmory speed limits on benning road outbound should not be as low as 35mph lots of jaywalking to cross maryland midblock crosswalk would be effective this crossing underneath the freeway feels extremely unsafe stairs here are broken and slippery add a protected bike lane on this bridge there are extra unused lanes and cars drive too fast cyclists struggling up hills go slower and cars will often try to overtake at unsafe speeds this intersection regularly backs up as northbound 15th trying to turn west to k street get trapped in the intersection as the signal at 15th k the next block to the west is a red light blocking cars from 15th vermont k intersection the pedestrian signal along the south side of h street for pedestrians across madison place says go at the same time as the light from vermont to madison place is green this puts cyclists and pedestrians in direct conflict no clear row is given every other trip i take southbound on 11th involves cars making a uturn they cant quite manage and blocking the roadway including the bike lane this is at the bottom of a long hill and there is frequently a green light someone will die here constant doubleparking the laundromat i think is the problem but who knows there are always cars doubleparked this is a busy street with many drivers speeding up and down this hill to get to bladensburg road or go west very high speeds limited visibilty bc of hill people crossing may not have time to get out of way of speeders many children here giant potholes pothole on a blind left turn drivers completely obstruct the rock creek path trying to turn onto beach drive the are very rude as well someone will die here need direct xwalk from eb bus stop on south k st median capital one bank across to nw corner of square svc lane is r turn only so no traffic conflict if eb peds cross here existing xwalk route indirect puts peds in conflict vs turning cars vehicles gun down park even though it is thick with pedestrians children and cyclists its already a confusing traffic pattern add the doubleparking and you have a rageclot always parked in the bike lane impossible to get from the bike lane on 4th to the weird sidewalk system down irving you have to cross up to four lanes of very fastmoving traffic and everyone is confused better signage would be a start a bike box would be ideal cyclists have no regard for pedestrians they fail to stop at the stop signs and even at the lights they block the crosswalk during morning rush time you will often find 23 cyclists riding side by side which is ridiculous and not safe it is perilous to cross here because the road is unnecessarily wide vehicles turning right onto 17th street rarely yield to pedestrians at this intersection the bike lane ends suddenly into a major intersection it would be safer and more helpful if it were to connect to the entry to rock creek parkway or at least down calvert to cleveland or 29th light timing includes no delay for driverscyclistspedestrians to clear the box many nearmisses as one light turns green the moment the other turns red crossing 17th here is difficult with vehicles turning out of the parking lots when the intersection was repaved the bike lane markings that crossed the intersection were never replaced replacing them may help boxblocking cars stay out of the way of bikes who have the row cars constantly make right turns from middle lane around buses ive seen dozens of near misses when the bus has had to slam on the brakes to avoid tboning the righthooking car cars constantly make right turns from middle lane around buses that are serving the stop on independence westbound ive seen dozens of near misses and one hit when the bus has had to slam on the brakes to avoid tboning the righthooking car this is a residential street with many peds and children cars frequently speed and drive recklessly the busses park here for breaks making it impossible to see oncoming traffic oncoming traffic cant see the stop sign or the crosstraffic this is a busy throughway for commuters often big buses trying to pass bikers with minimal passing space and parked cars that limit visibility on the sides of streets also speeding is a concern up and down wv in general i am ashamed of my fellow cyclists they run this light in every direction all the time its the worst i am propublic transit but the busses cut cyclists off constantly and abruptly here i get forced into traffic daily which pisses off the cars it is difficult to see pedestrians and the traffic signal when passing under the train tracks this is exacerbated by speeding cyclists are biking southbound on oneway street there is no nearby marked southbound bike lane forcing bikers to go against traffic in the lane here speeding drivers seldom stop for pedestrians at this intersection the pedestrian signal to cross east capitol street at 2nd street does not coincide with the green automobile traffic signal the pedestrian signal only lasts for about 20 seconds but cars have a much longer green than that speeding on this bridge exacerbates all other pedestrian problems there is no bus stop route x2 for the back entrance of union station few cars obey the speed limit on this unnecessarily wide stretch next to a school speeding is a large problem in the northbound lanes its like nascar up in here which makes it v difficult to make the left turn to the bike system the signage here does not suit the intersection two lanes of north bound traffic under the over pass suddenly become one and there is no rule in place for who gives way nor is there any help with street markings lack of enforcement of cars parking on the right side of the street force drivers into the bike lane on this block the light on garfield street last only 15 seconds therefore the cars coming from garfield street and turning on wisconsin often dont want to stop for pedestrians intersection dangerous for pedestrians cars heading east on massachusetts and turning right on wisconsin ave heading south barely slow down and often dont stop for pedestrians on the sidewalk almost got hit several times even more dangerous in winter time low luminosity traffic lights are poorly timed the green light to head east on independence turns before those heading north on 3rd have cleared the intersection speeding is also a problem here so much speeding on blair can we calm the traffic down here for the sake of the neighborhood missing sidewalks on the north side of missouri here this is a very wide street and a long distance to cross especially for neighbors like us who are elderly or who have small children thank you three bikeshare stations along georgia ave from emerson to new hampshire ave zero bike lanes on georgia ave im constantly honked at cut off and generally bullied by drivers biking on georgia ave is extremely unsafe cars rarely stop for pedestrians at this crosswalk it could benefit from repainting with stripes and possibly a sign for better visibility to drivers please consider changing the direction of this street and adding separated bicycle access m is used as a freeway onramp at present with cars rarely stopping 6th street can serve the same purpose and not at the expense of a neighborhood street carsvans pass very close and at very high speed no curb cut onto the sidewalk cars try to quickly merge from two lanes under the bridge into one lane on k st drivers pass bikers very quickly and unsafely i am always nervous that someone will collide with me when driving as well cars often run this red light in all directions especially at night no curb cut to get from one side of the street to the other or to the case bridge walkway on this stretch of 4th street between h and stanton park there is at least one doubleparked car every morning usually parked within 20 ft of a valid parking space drivers travel very fast down k st often whipping around turning cars and stopped buses to pass bike lane needs repainting vehicles turning from north carolina onto eastbound penn avenue frequently fail to yield to pedestrians in the crosswalk vehicles trying to make the light drive at excessive rate of speed vehicles using rumsey court as a cut through pose a danger to pedestrians and residents who live in rumsey court speed humps and stop signs needed vehicles picking up and dropping off passengers at the c street center double park or block the alley entrance marked bike lane needed bike box needed long wait encourages jaywalking speed monitoring and enforcement needed stop sign or signal needed on independence taxi taking high speed left thru crowded crosswalk miracle no one wasnt struck street too narrow to accommodate two way traffic with large commercial trucks and tourbuses street too narrow to accommodate two way traffic with large trucks and tourbuses wait is too long to cross d street light is timed to accommodate commuters cutting through residential neighborhood as opposed to pedestrians not enough time for pedestrians to cross penn avenue many families cross here to get to brent elementary rumsey pool and eastern market high incidence of red light running school zone sign with flashing light needed need better placement of school zone sign vehicles illegally parked in no parking zone pose a danger to pedestrians drivers routinely exceed posted 25 mph speed limit on straightaway sections of m st se in 5 years of working at this location im not sure ive ever seen speed enforcement terrible street design invites speeding as well drivers making turns at this intersection often fail to yield to pedestrians or try to sneak by before large groups from the metro city should consider whether accessible ramp could be built between nj ave and garfield park at or near the stairs location would provide important connection for disabled cyclists stroller users etc no stop sign for drivers on nh ave at this intersection and those drivers often fail to stop for pedestrians confusing intersection and a long distance to cross especially when driving on 8th st often unclear who has the right of way after coming to a stop cars parks too close to alley entrance interfering with sight lines for vehicles exiting alley cars park too close to alley entrance interfering with sight lines of vehicle exiting alley shrubs on public parking pose danger to pedestrians approaching alley entrance school zone sign with flashing lights needed food trucks in no parking zone ideally in poor visibility for cars turning from eastbound d street onto southbound first street cars going thru red long after light has turned and at speed during early morning rush and weekends when traffic is light many cars are 40 mph drivers often run red lights on m st both at this intersection and at other lights along the street its worse at new jersey due to high pedestrian usage from the metro exit more risk cars frequently speed around this circle and almost never stop for pedestrians because the circle is two lanes wide even if one car does stop often others will pass that car issue is compounded by very long distance to cross the north sidewalk in the 100 block of l st se is in awful condition it is broken and uneven after rain large puddles cover the whole sidewalk combined with the closure for construction on the south side pedestrians often walk in the street the stoplight signals for people traveling westbound on m st are very confusing the west side lights sometimes turn green while the east side lights are still red drivers unfamiliar with this run the red lights illegal uturns across the bike lane are really scary when you are riding along on a bike commuters using street as a cut through drive at excessive rate of speed speed humps and raised crosswalks needed due to proximity to school and park pedestrians walking north and south along the eastern side of 11th street crossing vermont ave have a hard time seeing traffic coming from 11th street due to the length and angle of the crosswalk the accessibility ramps at the crossing of 2nd st se do not align with each other the marked crosswalk goes from one ramp directly to the solid curb on the other side instead of connecting the ramps left turn on green arrow only confuses many drivers because the sign is very small have even had metro bus drivers sit on their horn or go around a set of cars waiting on a green for the green arrow very long distance to cross for people walking provide a bump out especially on the downhillwest side to keep cars heading up adams mill from taking that right turn too fast bikebox needed bike lane needed drivers block crosswalk mid block pedestrian crossing needed to walk between parks delivery trucks double parked barn dance crosswalk needed accessible passage should be built between garfield park and 2nd st se many people use this as a pedestrianbikestroller connection before closure for va ave tunnel project city should formalize make prominent pedestrian passage here stairs in garfield park that allow people to walk through and under interstate do not have handrails and are not maintained in winter eg with salt to avoid ice city should use opportunity of va tunnel project to make this a prominent pathway cars use the break in the bike lane protection under the bridge to park challenging intersection when crossing kansas9th when driving on varnum st kansas ave drivers do not have a stop sign and are often travelling quickly and on varnum you must peer around parked cars look for cars and frequent pedestrians there is an out of state commuter charter bus that stops in the bike lane to discharge passengers here on a regular basis drivers block crosswslk cars illegally parked cars drive and park on sidewalk stop light needed elementary school on same block crosswalk needed in front of library intersection of south carolina and seventh very hazardous for pedestrians vehicled turning westbound onto pennsylvanis fail to yield to pedestrians jaywalking double parking delivery trucks double parkef cars exiting gas station fail to yield to pedestrian cars entering parking area fail to yield to pedesrians no right on red needed 7 am to 7 pm the angle of this intersection makes for a very long distance to cross from the north side of harvard to argonne place and there is no painted crosswalk a pedestrian refuge would be helpful because cars going west on harvard have no stop sign with construction moving the crosswalk south of the intersection and no longer controlled by a signal it is virtually impossible to cross in the temporary crosswalk without a nearmiss with traffic accelerating to highway speeds and trying to merge bicycle lane on 11th st is not marked through the intersection at pennsylvania and given the additional turning lanes for cars it causes vehicles going straight through on 11th to have to go wide and the bike lane should be striped to do the same bike lane disappears for this short block of 15th st ne between constitution ave and north carolina ave creating a hazard for cyclists please restripe to include bike lane gush hour lanes poorly marked many near misses each evening bike lane needs to be painted green bike lane needs to be painted green for better visibility rumble strips needed mid block to slow vehicles for school zone street too narrow for twoway traffic consisting of trucks and tourbuses very dangerous for cyclists using cabi station at d and third street c street and ondepdndence avenues not an alternative option for cyclists walking east on irving you have less than 20 seconds to cross 16th and 15th streets which includes detouring around rotting plywood that has been covering a hole in the sidewalk for many months there is a stop for pedestrian sign but cars regularly blow by it cyclists do not stop for pedestrians in crosswalks new cycletrack has lead to several near collisions between bikespeds additional signs to clarify right of way or stop signs are needed curb cut here is too far into the road it feels like cars are going to hit you when you are a pedestrian on the nw corner its also close to the driveway entrance to the hotel causing cars to quickly shift into the left lane but on the angled rd rush hour lanes poorly marked bike lane needs to be painted green with better markings at ontersections bulb outs needed on west side of third street to improve visibility for pedestrians and vehicles too many cars roll through the stop sign many near misses due to poor sight lines when exiting alley and excessive speed of commuters and large trucks and buses vehicles illegally parked too close to corner block crosswalk and create a hazard for pedestrians cars try to beat the light when turning and endanger children and ddot crossing guard red light camera needed cars turning right on to constitution from louisiana routinely blow through the red light at high speeds failing to yield or even look out for the high volume of pedestrians and cyclists this intersection should prohibit right turns on red doubleparked cars block the bike lane along this stretch of 14th street every day please enforce bike track through lafayette square is constantly and randomly being closed by usss please keep it open it is a major through way to connect 15th street bike lane and penn ave bike lane there are constantly carstrucks double parked in the bike lane in front of the hotel now that there is a beautiful new bike lane starting at the top of the hill at mass ave and 1st st ne i have experienced being beeped at with a bike bell as a bike sped by while i was crossing the bike lane in the crosswalk motorists entering p street westbound from the circle frequently violate the rightturn red light speeding into a pedestrian walk strip delivery trucks making uturns to access loading docks fail to yield to pedestrians parents at basis school block crosswalk for drop off and pick up dangerous for children crossing street from metro to the school drivers consistently roll through the crosswalk to make a right on red onto q st no right on red sign would make this intersection safer there is no pedestrian light when crossing from u to 16th this makes it very confusing and dangerous as drivers turning to go south on new hampshire do not yield to pedestirans construction is illegally blocking the sidewalk without providing a safe walking route on v st there is no crosswalk to get from iowa to buchanan there needs to be a crosswalk that directly connects the west sw corner of iowa and the sw corner of buchanan excessive speeding along arkansas it is excessively far to cross on the south side of florida across 11th and on the east side of 11th across fla please add bump outs very long distance to cross for seniors speeding here on piney branch for folks from maryland cutting into the city and onto georgia or over to 16th would be great to have better markings signage and traffic calming for us residents we need some better signalling and bikeped infrastructure at this intersection i was just riding legally on aspen and stopped at the light to the right side and was repeatedly honked at by a driver who demanded that i get out of the road the lanes at this intersection are way too wideits one lane in each direction but theres so much space that cars pull next to eachother to turn and drive fast when cutting through to blair please add bumpoutscurb extensions thanks this sidewalk directly in front of the high school has no curb ramps please add to make it more pedestrian friendly esp for those with disabilities mayflower hotel regular keeps valet cars across 23 lanes narrowing ct ave appreciably ive observed this repeatedly cause nearmisses for cyclists heading nb on ct ave crossing across 16th street on the north side of m st is very long because the curb steps back by the hotel on the nw corner trucks at the courtyard marriott completely block the sidewalk when parked at the loading dock pedestrians have to walk into moving traffic to get around especially dangerous in am rush when curb lane is moving traffic the traffic light on 4th st at n carolina ave needs to turn green sooner so traffic can clear the block between n car and pa ave before the light turns green on sb 4th st just needs to turn green about 3 seconds sooner missing crosswalks necessitate lengthy indirect multiple crossings thus everybody myself included jaywalks the crosswalks need to be added im actually a resident and our vehicle has been hit in the rear and a sideview mirrow knocked off construction vehicles and containers cause a lot of weaving with the speeding make it a very dangerous street no left turn lane markings in the 3 lanes at the east intersection of i st and 11th means that cars turn left from both the far left and middle lanes cars turning left from the middle do not see bicyclists in the left lane sharp turn at bottom end of ped bridge puts you into the plaza at the metro a warningslowpeds ahead sign would be useful to warn bikes and reduce speed conflicts i live on k st and drivers go way to fast on this street drivers frequently blow through this crosswalk without stoppingor even realizing there is a crosswalk the corner is far too rounded making it very difficult for pedestrians to see cars coming up behind them extremely unsafe the corner at this intersection is far too rounded pedestrians cant see cars coming up behind them this corner desperately needs a curb bulbout or other traffic calming or just close the section of vermont ave between logan cir and o st the crosswalk light here is very very short i see most people jaywalking as a result which is very dangerous on the circle the crosswalk light needs to be longer this is a high pedestrian traffic area drivers frequently blow through this crosswalk its a very confusing intersection and many drivers dont realize theres a crosswalk or stoplight this intersection is in desperate need of a redesign its a pedestrian death waiting to happen to cross nh here you have to walk across two sides of a triangle both of which have a long wait the pedestrians cross at cross walks signs are futile why would a pedestrian spend 2 minutes waiting at two lights cross a street i got hit on my bike by a car sedan that was pulling into the pmi garage because the parking spots that are between the bike lane and moving traffic were all full of suvs perhaps those spots shouldnt be usable during rush hours thanks no speed signs cars cut through k and speed up to 35 mph or higher have hit parked cars already were residents of k and since the 11th street bridge and new entrance ramps opened about a year ago we see many speeding cars using k as a shortcut between 11th and barney circle cars will fly though here at high speed many are cutting through to franklinvista and are attempting to be faster than traffic down franklin i am a resident on k stse and my car was hit while i was parked they never slowed down ps i was in the car there are also young children in the block and one day it is going to end badly drivers routinely block this crosswalk leaving pedestrians stranded in the island in the middle of the road drivers routinely miss this red light seemingly confused by logan circles layout the circle has far too many intersections with roads resembling freeway exit ramps which encourages reckless driving a pbl is desperately needed on the entire length of connecticut there is no real biking alternative for the many residents of this part of upper nw cars speed and act aggressive on the wide road and six rush hour lanes seems excessive there have been two fatal hit and run pedestrian crashes this year in the 1300 block of southern cars turning left onto 14th going north and south often seem to only see pedestrians in the crosswalk after they are too close regularly watch northbound drivers on 15th make a left on mass when the turn signal is red today it happened in front of 3rd district police car p302 and the cop did nothing driver then went on to nearly crash into someone at the next intersection unsafe intersection for pedestrians too confusing drivers routinely block crosswalk southbound at 16th and monroe even with pavement markings cars turn right without looking merging into the bike lanevery dangerous for bikers riding straight on r i drive a car too so i have sympathy for drivers who dont understand thisbut its still a problem cyclists often ride the wrong way in the bike lane creating an extremely dangerous situation for bikers using the lane correctly often people will walk up the driveway into the harris teeter parking garage instead of using the walkway no bike facilities on this street big fat useless median 3 lanes in each direction but nothing for cyclists why does ddot hate cyclists why does ddot prioritize selfish car driving above all else before and after basball games the lack of traffic lights at this and other intersections in the area along with the significant vehicular and pedestrian traffic result in dangerous and difficult situations for all modes of transportation this neighborhood is used as a short cut often with ppl stopping at mcds on 16thpenn typically with md plates not dc they drive too fast for a neighborhood are often distracted it is dangerous to cross the street w children or pets no bike lane narrow traffic lanes no turn pocket lots of pedestrians traffic too fast for conditions left turn across two oncoming lanes four lane configuration encourages speeding and is harder to cross safely road diet explain to me why pedestrians lose half their sidewalk here so that this hotel can have a parking spot pedestrians have rights too but walking through here is a crowded maze xing from sw corner of f and capital cant do have to cross north and people jaywalk like crazy overall the area is awkward for pedestrians and volumes are pretty high given union sta in the area street too wide for amount of traffic please reduce to 2 lanes and 12 parking lanes and add bike lanes please retrofit these barriers to allow cyclists to easily pass through just as they do at the white house illegal use of handicapped parking space westbound drivers enter intersection on yellow and hit stopped traffic blocking crosswalk pedestrians dont realize there are two separate walk signals they just see the walk sign for the far side and walk right out into traffic clearer signage or synchronized lights would make this intersection safer when crossing from m street towards 14th st theres a tree with overgrown branches that obstruct the crossing signal and make it difficult to see if pedestrians can cross and the time left to cross drivers routinely block crosswalk also west bound left turns conflict with ped movement cyclists often ride the wrong way in the bike lane creating a dangerous situation for bikers using the lane correctly drivers going west on mass love to run this red light its a short green for them but thats no excuse drivers going around the circle also love to run reds through the pedestrian crossing here and often end up sitting here during congestion this crosswalk here is ridiculously long just to cross a 1 lane road the curb ought to be extended on both sides as is car drivers like to charge up to the stop line at high speed and dodge pedestrians given the ample room crossing from rhode island to p or vice versa is made unnecessarily slow by a poorly coordinated walk signal crosswalk missing on the south side of this intersection also there is no stop line for drivers once again utility work was done and no one from the city made sure that everything was returned to its original state pedestrian signal to cross 19th st on the north side of this intersection turns to solid red 20 seconds too early it turns to red the same time as the left arrow from penn ave to h st even though pedestrians still have 20 seconds to cross 19th st pedestrians on the nw corner of this intersection often stand in the road stand too close to the intersection dont look at traffic moving west from new york ave the road angle speed means they are frequently at risk for getting hit many pedestrians jwalk here to get to the bus stop on the west side of 16th street i have seen this cause one car accident and multiple near misses the road is unnecessarily wide here vermont is unnecessarily wide at this intersection please retrofit barriers to allow bikes to pass through just as they do at the white house 70 sec wait to cross is ridiculous for the low traffic on this street and everyone crosses against the light because of it please reduce this time to 1530 seconds maximum no way for wheelchair to access ally without going into street driver drove over the pedestrian island and turned south on 14th from westbound park drivers continue to attempt to turn from nebraska onto mass ave as if this is a true traffic circle creating a highly dangerous traffic situation this has been observed nearly every time i am driving through the circle the bike lane runs on the right hand side but many cars are trying to split off right through the bike path many buses and trucks go right through here as well causing a true safety hazard for bicyclists traveling down ny ave many bicyclists heading west on r street ignore the red lightno crossing pedestrian signal and cross which then can cause near collisions with the bicycles heading south on 15th who still have a signal 7 lanes of straight roads encourages speeding well beyond posted limits lanes are rarely used fullythis would be a prime candidate for a protected bike lane to connect pennsylvania avenuechinatown to the waterfront the stop signs on taylor need signs that indicate that the traffic on 7th does not have a stop sign twice in the past week ive been almost hit by a car going through taylor because the driver thought i was supposed to stop the pedestrian signal to cross 19th st on the north side of this intersection turns solid red 20 seconds too soon it turns solid red when the left arrow for traffic from penn to h st turns green but there are still 20 seconds left to cross why is there a highway style right exit lane here all up and down pa car drivers turn from the main road the extra lane here encourages car drivers to take this turn at high speed also pedestrians forced to cross more road cars do not stop for pedestrians the road widens here why so that cars can take turns at high speeds this is an area with a lot of pedestrians and the crossing is unnecessarily wide police cars and dhs police cars frequently park illegally between the crosswalk and last legal parking space greatly reducing visibility for cars turning onto m or new jersey curb extensions would be a great addition here a lot of speeding and during rush hour its not uncommon to see cars driving in the wrong lane who dont realize it becomes 4 2 there are two traffic signals intended to stop wb fl ave traffic often the westernmost by wendys is green while the easternmost by apt is red drivers often dont see the first signal heads and blow through the red light bc the other is green traffic signal cycle length too long reduce eastbound fl ave thruleft green time since there are zero leftturning vehicles this takes green time from nb traffic needed and wb fl ave traffic that are both held up for zero eb leftturning cars nbsb drivers on eckington dont see stop signs bc the road is so wide and wind up blowing through wout stopping consider road diet to shorten crossing distance and bring stop signs into drivers sights its not clear that this is a oneway eb street lots of drivers go the wrong way there are one or two oneway signs but i think having pavement markings of a couple single arrows pointing east would make it much clearer to drivers please ban right turns on red here because drivers often pull way into the cycletrack before turning it is unsafe for cyclists steep hill is inaccessible and traffic does not stop for pedestrians frequently run stop signs the bike lanes here are useless cars park in them every morning thanks ddot for putting cyclists in danger drivers heading east on massachusetts frequently go over the line when going around the angle creating a huge risk to westbound drivers who have to merge right suddenly to avoid getting hit often causing them to clip the curb ddot has painted all of these hashed lines around the circle but they provide no actual protection for pedestrians and are routinely violated by car drivers why not actually extend the curb or use bollards or planters with the painted lines explain to me how this road should have four lanes of parking and no bike facilities hamilton is part the interim route on the northern end of met branch trail from 3rd street to fort totten drive but the conditions on hamilton are terrible for bicycles the street desperately needs to be resurfaced cars dont stop for pedestrians or bicyclists a light has been suggested i would suggest also enforcement give warnings then tickets to remind motorists that they must yield to those in crosswalk should be paint to show that there is a crosswalk at the top of bates and ft totten drive signs warning motorists on ft totten would help too if you push the button you get a walk signal but it doesnt change the light any faster there are many bikes crossing at this intersection please install a sensor thats sensitive to bikes this is part of the interim bike route there are lots of bikes that cross here please install a sensor thats sensitive to bikes this is part of the interim bike route there are many bikes that cross here please install a sensor thats sensitive to bikes ive nearly been hit twice at this intersection in the past two weeks today a car turning westbound onto aspen from sandspring flew the intersection without even stopping and nearly sideswiped me we can do better to make this place safe crosswalk needs repainting lines should be drawn on sidewalk section of mbt aug 26 1130 am dc plated car ee 6205 came southbound on 37th st and cut across in front of us turning left onto whiteh we were on ped cross on wrong side the driver was busy with his cellphone clearly visible as he passed in front of us please ban right on red because cars will cut off cyclists in the cycletrack to make these turns right on red onto first st ne and right on red onto k st ne very step corner where cars come down the hill quickly and dont completely stop at stop sign very hard to see pedestrians blocking alley access for second house in the drive one house monopolizing and blocking public alley pedestrians on the nw corner of this intersection often stand in the road stand too close to the intersection dont look at traffic moving west from mt vernon pl the road angle speed means they are frequently at risk for getting hit cars do not respect the priority for the crosswalk long wait to cross and dangerous when pedestrian or cyclist engages into crosswalk lines are erased on the floor leading to confusion for some drivers drivers do not see the light and tend to run through cars go too fast here this block is exceptionally long encouraging jaywalking drivers rarely stop for pedestrians crossing 16th st at the uncontrolled xwalks very nervewracking because of the multiple moving lanes path is waaaaay too narrow 13th turns is marked with two lanes at this intersection but the left lane needs to be marked for cars bearing left on 13th only and the right lane needs to be marked for cars bearing right on tenn only to cross the street on 24th st nw between the two sides of virginia ave it can get very dangerous as most cars are speeding and do not stop for pedestrians despite the sign saying pedestrians cross here the intersection is used by many residents pedestrian signal instruction peds to not walk on the sidewalk is highly unusual and unexpected resulting in cars exiting verizon center parking while peds are on sidewalk requirement to press ped signal actuator beg button results in many peds never getting walk signal and then crossing on dont walk resulting in unsafe conditions lack of crosswalk across beach drive results in lots of jaywalking across beach around a curve with speeds at around 35 mph signage should instruct peds to use zoo overpass when open but a solution is needed for when zoo is closed please trim the trees hanging over the bike lane especially around the curve no crosswalk between the northwest corner of connecticut and cathedral and the northeast corner this forces pedestrians to go out of their way to cross the street this is a normal intersection so there should be a crosswalk lots of flagrant red light running on mass during rush hour connecticut traffic needs crosswalk no way for peds to cross florida here the stronghold alleys are animportant corridor for pedestrians bicyclists and children at play and its nearly everyday i see a driver slam on their brakes and a nearmiss after speeding through an alley oneways will not suffice because of the church homeless people gather on the sidewalk not only completely blocking it but also making it dirty and smelly ns 6th street ped signal terminates over 5 seconds before ns traffic signal turns yellow triggering some peds to walk out into traffic while opposing traffic still has the green cars heading eastbound on upshur try to fly through the intersection to make the light and block the crosswalk across upshur here we really really need separate protected bike lanes along 11th st here theres so much conflict between cars and people on bikes and it could be addressed with better separation and safety no crosswalk between the southwest corner of connecticut and sedgwick and the eastern sidewalk of connecticut this forces pedestrians to cross sedgwick first delaying travel no walk signal when crossing sedgwick despite the traffic light for vehicular traffic i have seen quite a few cars run red lights here there should be a red light camera both on albemarle and nebraska needs crosswalks this intersection has a light for crossing but no painted crosswalks cars speed both ways on fl to go straight through this light sb traffic veers right on to vt wo yielding to pedestrians cars on vt speed to get through their green to turn onto fl crosswalks feel dangers to pedestrians no matter who has a green cars are constantly speeding down this section this should be a four way stop cars veer on to vermont without yielding to pedestrians visibility is poor at this intersection construction dumpster blocking view for drivers exiting alley on east side of 10th st se cars turn from kansas southbound onto longfellow at very high speeds there are several long gaps in the sidewalk on the northside drivers routinely enter the intersection before they can cross it completely and end up endangering pedestrians who are trying to cross by making it difficult to impossible for them to move safely across or see oncoming traffic sidewalk ends in a dirt path it is almost impossible to cross grant circle as a pedestrian we need dedicated pedestrian signals or crossing phases similar to those at logan circle drivers ignore the stop signs and routinely speed every morning theres lots of cyclist traffic down 17th but no bike line every morning theres some delivery truck making the cars and the cyclists move over 945 usually and it gets very dangerous the sidewalk south side of florida ave ne between 7th and m is extremely narrow plus there are barriers like poles stair rails for house porch please widen the sidewalk and perhaps add a bike lane on the side as hit two birds with one stone need to add vibrating crosswalk signal button for the deafblind and blind pedestrians on both sides of the street at every corner plus add bumps on sidewalk ramp to indicate end of sidewalk for deafblind and blind thank you please add a bike lane perhaps starting at nomagallaudet station all the way to west virgina eastbound as a start add bumps on corner of ramps on sidewalk on both sides for deafblind and blind to know its the endbeginning of sidewalk 1st st has no stop sign but ingraham has a stop yet ingraham is a larger road this should be a fourway stop or at the very least there should be a opposing traffic does not stop sign like there is half a block away at new hampshire cars going south on 15th st nw often run the red light way after its turned red either theres something wrong with the light placement or the drivers are tourists who arent used to lights on the side of the street rather than overhead look out this intersection is very dangerous for peds bc southbound traffic on 13th has 2 lights right in a row the first green the second red you see a grn light and say ok i can go and then within just a few ft is a red light where peds are crossing cars in the inner circle try to make left hand turns onto mass ave illegally creates a dangerous situation when they pull in front of oncoming traffic entering the circle need better signs and enforcement issues occurs 50 of the time museum of nat hist 10th and constitution ave nw drivers do not see the traffic light heavy pedestrian traffic during summer would love to see this intersection painted with heavy stripes just like at the national zoo cars going eastbound on varnum from 22nd often dont even slow down at the stop sign let alone pretend to stop especially at beginning and end of school day walking along with my son who was on his balance bike after we crossed half of the street a car coming from the way of wfs zoomed in front of us if i did not pull my son back he would have been hit the driver waved his hand apologetically cars on yuma routinely speed are not from dc but are cut through traffic and this morning i witnessed a car pass another car in the same direction on a residential street because it was too slow to that person 17th st traffic does not stop for pedestrians at a st se car racing down 13th street far over 25mph speed limit car speeding up park road from rock creek park around blind turn before bridge nearly hitting cyclists and oncoming cars cars speed on this block frequently as they cut through the neighborhood cant see traffic coming from east on river road when crossing 45th neighborhood driver cars speed down 41st and fail to stop at stop signs at harrison and garrison several nearmiss accidents with pedestrians many children walking in neighborhood cut through traffic headed eastbound during morning rush hour tends to speed also causes slowdowns for the h2 buses which are headed westbound drivers traveling southwest on nebraska during morning rush hour often bypass stalled traffic by turning right on albemarle and then left on fort drive back to tenley circle these extra cars make it hard for pedestrians at albemarle fort deal student walking south on 38th st nearly hit by car driver failing to stop a stop sign camera here or other enforcement here is needed drive too fast elderly woman nearly hit by speeding car need speed bumps or camera our familys car had the side mirror damaged by speeding car going from wisconsin toward conn car kept going very fast down the street cars fly down south dakota ave there are two schools on perry with lots of foot traffic as well as an athletic field for childrens sports the speed camera on the block slows most traffic on that side but its not enough turning right from eastbound michigan requires a very sharp turn that most drivers are just not capable of as a pedestrian i never feel safe at this intersection thomas circle is proof that ddot doesnt care about cyclists and maybe straight up wants them to die fix this very dangerous intersection urgent need to align fort dr and davenport st also probably regrade current poor sight lines confusing signals high speeds and large numbers of middle school pedestrians make for a tragedy waiting to happen deal student walking south on 38th st nearly hit by car driver failing to stop extremely dangerous and confusing there is no stop sign here but all other streets crossing 39th st have a stop sign please install stop sign here child walking dog nearly hit by speeding car install speed bumps nanny and child in stroller nearly hit by car that was speeding down yuma street as it came off of wis trying to speed to conn a speeding car got too close to child getting in his car seat speeding cars on this block every day please enforce speed limit this segment of d street would benefit from resurfacing the light timing here is truly awful and hostile to pedestrians hey ddot the people on foot matter just as much as the people in cars and there are a lot of people on foot here in dupont the light timing here is downright hostile to pedestrians there is approximately a 1 second window for pedestrians to start walking or else they wont be able to make it the whole way and have to stand on an awful little island and wait drivers regularly role through this stop sign in an area where pedestrians regularly cross at dusk i was doored by a driver on his cell phone in a car2go even though i had bright led headlamp flashing this would be a good block to make one way for auto traffic heading south and install a dedicated 2way bike lane east sidewalk is closed off due to construction sidewalk on west side by train track wall is very narrow pedestrians often have to go into the street to pass one another there is no curbcut to cross planter does not allow access through sidewalk and a little ways up loose bricks on sidewalk uneven concrete in the sidewalk blocks walkers part of a fence has fallen off onto the sidewalk cars from the inner ring are required to turn onto mass but illegally cross through an active crosswalk with a walk signal between p and the circle at high speeds these car drivers are maniacs and law breakers ill never understand why street parking was put in here with a giant garage built at city center whats the point this should be a complete street for through traffic and cyclists why devote this public space to parking black suv ran this light after it was fully red this am at 817 9142015 red sedan ran this light after it had turned fully red held up traffic 9142015 access vehicle small bus private transport sped by to cut off a biker someone speeds by only to slam on the brakes every day on this stretch of irving cars plug this intersction up constantly this means that traffic crossing sherman lunges and gets angry and cyclists get caught in the crossfire construction completely blocks access to wheelchairs small hill obstructs people with walkers and wheelchairs dip in the sidewalk and loose bricks obstruct wheelchairs and walkers gutter overflow onto sidewalk tree roots obstruct sidewalk uneven sidewalk texting and driving uneven sidewalk that will cause people to trip cars are constantly flying through this intersection next to the rec center and high school without stopping or barely slowing down can we please make this intersection safer for children and elderly users cars moving both directions on 11th persistently run this light someone will die here cars back up make sightlines and left turns on to r impossibly dangerous for cyclists this is a daily occurence drivers try to get through the light get stuck and block the intersection crosstraffic gets mad and surges and bikes get caught in the crossfire i have yet to cross this intersection without a pedestrian crossing against the light and then getting mad they cant all be colorblind the cars speed past before throwing on the brakes to doublepark always at rush hour why cars blatantly run this red both east to west and when turning right vehicles dont stop cars barrel down this road its right next to a school and extremely unsafe southbound vehicles regularly fail to stop at this stopsign esp turning right cars speed down a bricklined alley to avoid the light there is a lot of foottraffic most of it children and the elderly cars trying to get to 16th block this intersection on the regular so do the busses cars are always doubleparked through this intersection cabs are always doubleparked trolling for bartraffic this intersection is extremely dangerous for pedestrians and for cars trying to cross dahlia visibility is poor and despite the pedestrian stop signs cars often speed by and do not stop many students cross here because of the school nearby between benning rd and nhb this is the only cross walk for over 5 blocks this is the only place to cross cars gum up the intersction and panic charging at cyclists and pedestrians drivers never stop they blast through this intersection and always fail to yield rightofway to through traffic bikes or other cars or pedestrians cars will fail to yield to anyone on a bicycle four cars will plow through the left turn without stopping disallowing biketraffic westbound on r street vehicles blow through this stopsign daily someone will die here very difficult to get through these intersections because cars are always hauling into the bike lanes and then having to stop cars peel through here very quickly they are always headed to a long red light its extremely unsafe for bikers especially give th giant potholes we have to avoid cars blow through here aggressively forcing cyclists into potholes and doors pedestrians here go whenever they please regardless of the lights this light is crazy i understand that its linked to the light on 16th but there is never traffic coming from the south constant and unending doubleparking cars do not stop at the stopsigns sounthbound cars peel right into oncoming bike traffic and through the pedestrian crossing major hazard the crosswalk on massachusetts and 4th is only 19 seconds and is just enough time for a able bodied person to cross the street safely for an elderly or handicapped person this is simply not enough time 30 seconds would seem more appropriate when heading westbound on dahlia across piney branch you cant see a thing you have to pull half way out into the street before you can tell if its actually clear cars regularly drive over the curb to park in fort mahan park it is very dangerous since they have to drive on the sidewalk to access the field in fort mahan park there is a crosswalk a little further north but with a grocery store and a high rise apartment building on the west side of the street many people coming from the south choose to cross here rather than walk further north and have to come back south a mirror is needed here so drivers are aware of a driver is approaching in the opposite direction there is only room for one vehicle going in one direction i live here and see cars speeding constantly there is an alley the cops could sit in to ticket people but they do not this corridor is designed to promote high speeds and i feel in danger being on a bike i try to bike on the sidewalk but its disrespectful with the high pedestrian traffic surrounding the hospital so i bravely take to the streets i have nearly been hit by a car once a month walking through our alleys which are often the place where children play and neighbors connect we need speedbumps there are two crosswalks on this section of 4th street and vehicles do not stop this is the most dangerous part of my commute westbound drivers from two lanes of traffic must merge into one lane where there is a high volume of bicyclists being instructed to follow the sharrow and take the lane but rarely do motorist routinely travel at high rates of speed when turning left from lincoln rd speeding cut through traffic from north capitol is endangering property and lives on this street needs signage new speed bumps and enforcement drivers often use bryant st as a cut through from lincoln to 4th street often speeding downup the hill on the 200 block the unit block of v street ne is a short cut from rhode island ave or lincoln ave to northbound n cap street cars speed down the street extremely fast which is very dangerous people blow through this constantly and it is directly across the street from a rec center where kids come and go i would sell my soul to the devil for a bike lane that spans columbia rd this is a major westbound bike commuter corridor and i see daily rage between roadusers being forced to share the road illegal parking especially during football games practice at the school this is a very dangerous crosswalk for pedestrians cars veer right to get on to lincoln from north capitol street at high speeds usually without signaling or looking for pedestrians need to remove parking spaces in the lane leading up to new york ave causes major traffic delays on north cap when traffic backs up this is the most dysfunctional intersection in the whole city get rid of the crazy wendys and build a functioning traffic pattern the crosswalk sign here is constantly being run over and dislodged causing problems this isnt a heavy pedestrian area and the nature of this turn make the crosswalk sign ill placed the sign should be removed the location is not correct but cant move it closer union station the crosswalk to get to columbus circle is almost always blocked by queuing cars the drivers do not pay attention to pedestrians as they are looking at people directing traffic good grief a sixeight lane road with no bicycle facilities hey ddot design a road to look like a highway and guess what car drivers will do slow this road down make it multimodal things ddot thinks are more important than providing a bike facility here two lanes of parking so bikers have to deal with cars trying to pass them with no space in the one remaining lane its a plague during rush hour cars sit in the intersection after their green light cycle terminates blocking both cars and bikes you should pursue using cameras at this intersection to enforce the law cars are able to take this turn at too fast of a speed with heavy pedbike traffic in the evenings a bulbout should be placed on se corner to slow cars and make for a safer environment concur with the prev comment here the problem as i see it is that the zipcar van acts as a obstruction for cars to see oncoming traffic vehicle or bike the van should be moved a few places away from the corner to permit better awareness this is one of the worst intersections in the city traffic comes from west virginia and off k street at crazy speeds and there are no stop signs until floridawest virginia and no one understands what to do at corner of 9th west virginia and l this is a very dangerous intersection for pedestrians cars turn left and right from ri and capitol through the crosswalk typically never slowing down i have had several near misses while pushing a stroller there is no automatic pedestrian walk signal in the direction of traffic flow pedestrians have to push a button for the walk signal this is a high pedestrian street bordering a university and an automatic walk signal would be very helpful motorists frequently speed through channing st 200 300 block using it as a cut through from lincoln st to 4th st ne there is part of the sidewalk that is gravel and dirt herejust to the east of the mcdonalds it gets very muddy and is slipperydirty for peds no one seems willing to take care of it this is a major artery for foot traffic going to the metro should be a xwalk connecting the gompers park island to the smaller traffic island existing route creates unnecessary detour for peds with long signal delays cars routinely block the crosswalk during morning rush hour making it difficult and sometimes impossible to cross the street safely cars routinely block the crosswalk during morning rush with absolutely no care for the safety of peds with strollers canes wheelchairs etc good grief all kinds of space available but this is designed like a highway for cars and with no facilities for bikes regardless of mode windows of cars are being broken along 15th between mass and ri eyes on the street here would be a good idea but at a minimum please clean up the glass in the bike lane too often peds are walking through the bike lane on 15th without recognition that bikes are coming creating a safety issue the nyc look campaign would be ideal for this corridor this intersection used to be well marked and painted not anymore the sign in the road instructing cars to stop for traffic is no longer there and 311 has failed to replace it upon requests put a bikeshare stand here dense housing no stand within blocks cyclists consistently speed down r street coming from n capitol without stopping or slowing at the intersection one just about hit the front of my car after i made a full stop looked both ways and proceeded north on first street there is a light by the mcdonalds that allows traffic exiting the ri shopping center to pull onto ri ave however there is no corresponding signage for pedestrians and its unclear if peds have the right of way or need to stop for cars cars pulling out of ri ave shopping center dont always acknowledge pedestrians which seem to have the right of way on the sidewalk i was almost hit here pushing a strollerthe car tried to turn right on red and didnt look for peds cars going sw on rhode island ave during the morning commute often block the intersection creating a back up on lincoln rd heading south because we can not use the already short green light there is a rush hour parking restriction in this block across from an elementary school motorists are zooming to get out of town past students getting picked up from after care get rid of the rush hour parking restrictions and calm the traffic someone parked a trailer that has a speed limit sign and speed display in the right lane of rhode island ave during rush hour this becomes a travel lane the sign is blocking traffic and causing a bottleneck i jaywalk here consistently because there is no decent way to cross 14th or the circle drivers often do an illegal left turn off franklin onto girard and drive the wrong way on oneway girard so they can to left andcut south down the alley along the cemetary they drive fast through blind alley corners where many children are walking multiple times a day due to worship services cars mostly with md plates ignore parking signs and park right up to the corner of the street making it extremely dangerous to cross 18th street which only has a twoway stop sign drivers turning right onto 14th from t street often dont look to see if any bikes coming up on their right in the designated bike lane causing bikes to brake suddenly or swerve into traffic commuters use 2nd st ne as a short cut en route to rhode island in the morning to bypass the traffic on lincoln blvd street safety could benefit from speed bumps as there are many small children on this block walking to school at shaed this route is often used by drivers to avoid traffic backups on monroe street as a result and because nearby blocks have speed bumps the block gets too many speeding cars this block should have speed bumps as well drivers on 4th street approaching michigan ave should be able to turn right on michigan ave on the green signal while yielding to pedestrians there is no reason to wait for the green arrow to turn right this causes unneccesary traffic backups cars are often illegally standing on the northbound side of the road on this block due to the apartments on that side it is very dangerous as it is a blind hill and traffic comes upon them quickly the alley along cemetery is use illegally like a street speeding cars in both directions and honking there is poor visibility on all turns and alley should be used as an alley only rhode island needs a bike lane there should be a leftturn signal installed for drivers coming south down nw 6 street who want to make a left onto new york avenue to head west there is a lot of traffic here during rush hour and it is unsafe for drivers pedestrians and bikes the one way sign has been damaged and is now turned in the wrong direction has been like this for 5 weeks the hill on bryant is conducive to bad behavior from dirtbikesatvs speeding traffic calming measures would deter this this is a very dangerous intersection need to align 40th fort and add a signal major conflicts here road is striped incorrectly not enough time to cross blocking the box the crosswalk here is not clearly marked as such drivers do not slow down or stop for people who need to cross the street here no one clears snowice from the south side sidewalk which is in the shade it ices over and doesnt clear for a long time always during football practicegames approx 530 pm always double parked cars i live on newton between 13th and 14th i am afraid that i will get hit crossing the street to get into my car we are applying to have speed bumps installed metro recently upgraded a bus stop for the k2 here many people myself included cross the street to and from this bus stop every day unfortunately there is no crosswalk from the bus stop on the east side of the street to the west side of blair rd there are not enough sidewalks on blair rd from riggs to milmarson this is the fastest walking route to the metro for many people but unnecessarily dangerous due to lack of sidewalks there needs to be a left turn light here if you are heading south on blair and need to make a left onto riggs you often have to wait one or more red lights due to the volume of traffic heading north from rock creek church it isnt clear how one is to transition from the barney circle sidewalkanacostia trail to traffic along barney circle or 18th some sort of transition area and signage is needed the sidepath begins here and there should be some signagemarkings to make this transition easier there are also some light post issues here for those moving from the road to the sidepath a sign designating it a bike facility would help too there is a lot of sand on the sidewalk on the north side not much maintenance the crosswalk light heading south is 10 seconds making it difficult to cross before westbound light changes driving on 13th from otis towards newton is downhill this intersection has no stop sign but has a pedestrian walkway no cars stop and speed so badly that its impossible for the pedestrian to cross the stop for pedestrian signs are not visible and are blocked by tree branches this is a slightly downhill street and there is no stop at the intersection of newton street and 13th speeding is atrocious cars always park on newton at the corner of 12th street there is a no parking sign but cars park and make it difficult to turn on to newton from 12th as there are oncoming cars from newton towards 12th you often times have to get into oncoming traffic in order to see to be able to merge or cross traffic drivers pull into the bike lane in the center to avoid double or tripleparked cars southbound drivers dont expect there to be a bike lane in the middle of the road and if they cut off a bike bicyclist has to swerve into oncoming traffic many parkits have already come detached from road by drivers still doing illegal uturns and when a driver does an illegal uturn over a detached one it is pushed into the middle of the cycletrack and left as an obstruction cars going east and west on morse st ne often do not stop at this 4way stop two of the corners are not ada accessible no zone 5 parking for 1200 block of orren st ne many people from starburst plaza cross the street here it is dangerous and illegal pavement condition in this area is extremely hazardous for westbound traffic after dc water pipe modernization project pavement patches are uneven and create fall hazards for cyclists forcing them to ride in the lefthand side of the lane both drivers and cyclists often fail to stop or even slow down on tunlaw street creating a hazardous situation for other road users both cyclists and drivers often run this stop sign on fessenden street especially westbound drivers wishing to turn right onto foxhall street nw often cut off cyclists who are trying to continue westbound on reservoir road nw poor lane markings and odd island placement make for a bottleneck for all road users bike lane has not been restriped in years rendering it invisible taxis and drivers turning into omni shoreham and other properties often drive in nowinvisible bike lane drivers going north or south on 4th st frequently run this stop sign i have had several near misses on foot and while driving because drivers speed through the sign the timing of the lights is too long at the entrance of elevation it seems to be timed more for residents there as opposed for drivers or pedestrians trying to cross the crosswalks and walk signals need to be reconfigured for the visually impaired i had to escort a blind woman across the street because it was impossible to know when the signal was changing or the direction of the crosswalk since there are two drivers like to hit injure and kill pedestrians who cross h st nw here httpmpdcdcgovreleasepedestriantrafficfatalityintersection1standhstreetsnw this section of southbound rock creek church is far too wide drivers constantly speed and often try to pass even though it is only 1 lane this section of new hampshire ave is very wide there is plenty of space to add a bike lane and bump outs for pedestrian crossings and buses my family bikes here often and the cross walk lights are horrible traffic light for northsouth traffic on 34th street nw is exceedingly short especially during high traffic volume times for a posted bike route its too short for the average rider to make safely bicycles wishing to cross westbound to allan street are often forced to wait a long time due to poor traffic light timing along western ave bicycles routinely run this stop sign when riding westbound on loughboro road reversion to more driving lanes has made this stretch of wisconsin avenue treacherous for cyclists cars pass at close distance and at high speed please put center turn lane back in and enforce 25mph limit wspeed cams having the safer passage here through the zoo close during hours when the zoo is also closed makes this a big safety risk as the tunnel sidewalk is too narrow to be safe for cyclists and pedestrians alike on weekends both drivers and cyclists routinely run the stop signs at this intersection creating conflict when driving along the n capitol overpass it is really difficult to see pedestrians at the intersection due to the metal screens the screens block my view as a driver causing me to have to ease forward to see who may be coming as many people have stated there are multiple issues wrong with this intersection i will add that the timing of the lights is entirely too short turning onto wb florida ave drivers turning dont see bikes and often force me onto sidewalk or to make risky move into left lane very narrow sidewalk being shared with pedestrians and bikers dangerous to pass either because it is so narrow as well as because of heavy traffic it is also not well lit in the late afternoonevening on the morning of 928 4 drivers came at me the wrong way on one way streets here 3 were drivers driving west on k one north on 10th this seems to be frequently done by people that want to go to the parking garage on k no bike facilities here the sidewalk is narrow and has chain links on both sides not suitable for biking the road is design like a highway theres plenty of space please give cyclists some drivers speed going westbound parked cars are usually absent at night and drivers use this space to unsafely pass needs curb bump outs one car driver will run this red light every single light cycle the design of this circle for bicyclists is just atrocious redesign this so that cyclists have their own space around perimeter and cars must cross it at a 90 degree angle as is cars drive in bike lane all the time the pedestrian signal head on the north side of ny ave facing west for pedesttians crossing the easternmost n capitol ramp is turned sideways and can not be seen double parking while dropping off students and high travel speeds make this a very dangerous stretch for bikers need better painted bike line cars turn through bike lane without looking for cyclists 17th street is one way south during the morning commute i am walking down 17th street and every day i see at least 2 cars turning from m street to go north on 17th because the illuminated one way signs are too dim for the drivers to see flooding at this intersection turning right from franklin onto lincoln rd ne during heavy rain dangerous due to no yielding of traffic when traveling east on f st it is difficult to see nebound traffic on tennessee ave which has no stop sign cars in inner loop of circle regularly fail to obey the must exit onto mass ave rules and continue around the circle conflicting with peds who have the walk signal better signs pavement markings and education needed to ensure pedestrian safety cars are always speeding through this intersection speed camera please there is no reason why dupont circle needs to be 4 traffic lanes wide this park and the quality of life for all community members and office workers would be greatly enhanced if the circle were increased by converting the narrowest lane to park road conditions on rcp are terrible cars should be totally banned on weekends either bury the streets crossing the mall or just get rid of them to have our national mall intersected by a bunch of 6 lane highways is a national disgrace would make a huge difference in the quality of life for all dc and visitors too southbound cars will constantly enter the bike lane at the bottom of the hill wo a signal to get around a car turning left at the intersection i have nearly been hit here 3x in 2wks please add l turn lane andor guardposts for bike lane theres a giant pothole here thats over 5 deep and hard to see on a blind left please fix walking to school with kids across 5th can be a challenge there are two schools right here and we have so many drivers from maryland speeding on 5th to avoid georgia traffic calming on 5th please construction forces bike and car lanes to merge and there is no signagelines to make that clear totally agree with all other posts about speeding this street is one of the worst ive seen in dc and there seems to be zero enforcement road conditions are terrible cars should be totally banned from beach drive its a park just as nyc recently did in central park bike facility here is not safe should be protected like the rest of m st many cars use the leftturn lane for westbound e st nw thinking its the straight lane nearly hitting cars driving correctly paint indicating that its a turn only lane further back may help cyclist hit by car cars in this parking lane frequently cut into bike lane without checking it is often taxis and short term parking lots of road rage at this intersection due to people illegally trying to turn left anytime someone does this drivers behind them lay on their horns and aggressively try to pass endangering pedestrianscyclists cross walk signal on the south east corner of 11th and e is turned around so pedestrians can not see whether it is walk or stop bike lane between north carolina and independence needs to be repaved waterline work at every house resulted in oneoff repairs that now make for an offroadlike ride painting bike lane green between penn ave and o st will improve awareness and safety for everyone especially during rush hour cars dont stop at this crosswalk its really dangerous to try to cross when going to the cemetery cars dont stop for pedestrians in crosswalk dangerous conditions very hard to cross the crosswalks because of cars cars turning at the light dont yield to pedestrians its hard to get across these crosswalks cars roll through stops hey ddot there are 6 lanes in each direction here how about some bike facilities pedestrian walk sign is turned on the southwest corner so pedestrians can not see when it is safe to cross biking on the road here is like biking on the interstate 30 mph speed limit is a joke this is a school zone yet commuters drive way too fast there is a leftturn signal from south dakota onto galloway and everyone from buses to school and clinic shuttles to ordinary cars run through the light after the leftturn signal goes away this makes it very dangerous for pedestrians there needs to be a crosswalk at this intersection see school kids crossing here to get to bus stop very dangerous cars speed through this intersection trying to catch the light at penn ave pedestrians are always at risk here cars and buses northbound from w virgina ave run the red light and block the intersection for montana ave to enter the circle the pedhead does not provide adequate time for pedestrians to cross riggs rd ne from 1st st ne thus making it dangerous for pedestrians there are no signs in the road warning drivers to stop for pedestrians which makes it dangerous for pedestrians including me to cross especially during rush hours speed bumps are way too high on this stretch of newton st forces drivers to slow to 5 mph to go over without damaging car even at 15 mph posted school speed limit drivers risk destroying their shocks this intersection has a strange zigzag alignment to stay on mo ave nw while crossing ga ave nw it can be confusing for drivers not familiar and pedestrians crossing there is a bus stop at this corner that is hard to get to because drivers are not expecting pedestrians here in the crosswalk we need those signs that mention a 250 fine for not stopping bike lane is useless here insanely dangerous after dark thurssun drivers dont obey the posted signs indicating which direction vehicles are to travel drivers make left turns onto new york ave from the florida ave lanes cars block the intersection maryland drivers cut thur the side streets to this street using this street to avoid traffic congestion on north capital st causing traffic backups crossing guard is at this location however he allows people to walk when cars have the green light cars travel the wrong way on the one way street durring morning and evening rush hour causing serious traffic issues drivers disobey the one way signs during rush hour drivers dont obey the posted signs indicating which direction vehicles are to travel drivers make right turn from the florida ave lane crossing the solid white lines over into the lanes intented for new york ave traffic cyclist run the stop sign cars on florida ave crossing new york ave driving towards the wendys run the red light on a daily basis drivers turning left need a turn signal several light cycles pass before one car is able to turn left causing serious traffic jams on blair rd construction workers on the north side in this block are blocking the bike lane with cones to divert the sidewalk around the work area during daytime hours but providing no accommodation for bicyclists so we are forced into oncoming traffic cars drive so quickly on 6th street and it is unsafe for bicyclists adding a protected bike lane on 6th street will make it safer for everyone and reduce injuries many cars speed by when pedestrians are trying to cross cars turning left from independence onto 4th st get a leading green arrow but often 23 cars continue to turn after the arrow has expired and the pedestrian signal has changed to walk and then fail to stop for pedestrians in the crosswalk i commute on wv avenue regularly commuter buses and circulator buses heading to the depot at night do not give bikes ample room too many close calls very unsafe we need a full bike lane not just a bike route many cars do not stop for pedestrians which compounds the fact that pedestrians often cross in areas apart from the crosswalk cars turning onto wv avenue from mount olivet often almost hit pedestrians because the light either doesnt have a green arrow or doesnt have a long enough one cars park beyond the no parking sign for the corner but are never ticketed they use the space between the sign and the corner as a parking spot blocking visibility turning r onto 11th street when coming down holbrook ter ne we need a complete eastwest bike route from ne dcgallaudet to mt vernon square need bike lane from 10th and k ne to k and 3rd nw pedestrian signal badly needed crosswalk is already there but it is confusingscary for pedestrians to dare venture into the street on a red light will it turn green as soon as i srep into the street crosswalks at 3rd and madison are unmarked cars do not stop for pedestrians consider striping crosswalks here drivers ignore stop signs on 5th street especially when trying to get around buses drivers turning left from l st eastbound onto connecticut northbound will routinely move into the bike lane in order to turn left this pushes cyclists into traffic bicyclists dont stop for chlidren in the crosswalk head to school in the morning even though there is a stop sign enforce double parking on weekends at st martins church bikers go south the wrong way down this bike lane frequently it is very dangerous because pedestrians arent looking for traffic going the wrong way down a one way street in addition it is downhill so bikers pick up a lot of speed pretty consistent speeding all hours of the day help im a mom with three babies and we can not push our stroller down the blair rd sidewalk it is narrow with crumbling brick dangerous holes fire hydrants in the middle of the walkway and inches away from speeding traffic please repair cars blatantly speed through the stop sign at blair and fern roads especially in the middle of the night there are drag races on the road between silver spring and takoma park please help before someone is badly hurt there are eleven small children that live around the intersection of blair and fern we greatly fear for our kids because of speeding drivers who ignore the stop sign and refuse to let pedestrians cross the street please help street light not working consistently often off nightsearly mornings nearest light to northbound bus stop making it difficult for a bus driver to see a pedestrian awaiting the bus street light not working consistently often off nightsearly mornings nearest light to southbound bus stop making it difficult for a bus driver to see a pede speeding is a big issue coming downhill westward on south dakota ave there is no pedestrian crossing signal on the west side of this intersection there is a crosswalk here but no stop sign no one stops for pedestrians in the crosswalk it is a lot like the frogger game particularly for folks trying to catch the 80 bus going in either direction there is a community center a popular church and a bus stop on the east side of the street people cross here but there is no cross walk it is dangerous for everyone for people turning right onto 12th street from south dakota heading west the crosswalk has poor visibility and is dangerous for pedestrians vehicles speed down michigan often up to 40 not only do cars speed they completely ignore the crosswalk i just came very close to meeting my maker this morning because of that the crosswalk is very faded there is no sloped curbramp at the east side of the intersection but no pedestrian signal on the west side leaving a very dangerous crossing for everyone but particularly those in wheelchairsin strollers someone was killed here after being hit by a car recently october 2015 a traffic light would help cars ignore oneway restrictions before 930 am along fairlawn dangerous for other drivers and peds for a several block stretch on the west side there is no sidewalk motorists do not stop here and they block crosswalks i see pedestrians who are afraid to cross the street because so many cars clog up the intersection and when there isnt congestion cars just blow through wo stopping poor line of sight from corner of decatur and arkansas for pedestrians trying to cross arkansas caused by retaining wall and fence and the angle of the road obstructed view and poor visibility combined with speeding cars taking a right from 13th street at a green light onto arkansas make crossing this intersection dangerous for cars no safe space for bicycles even though road is wide enough for bicycle facilities most dangerous during morning rush hours but all of the time there is very little observance of the 4way stop signs many moning commuters are very aggressive about not stopping for any reason this 1300 block of d st ne is 2way but the 1200 block is one way eastbound vehicles often drive down the middle of the 1300 block or even in the lefthand lane also dangerous for pedestrians and bike not expecting someone on the wrong side cars are routinely driving in andor parking in the separated cycle track on first street ne the raised table street between the atf building and the metro entrance has a stop sign on one side and no stop sign on the other it needs to have stop signs on both sides pedestrians have been hit the abandoned pedestrian crossing stripes installed for construction have not been removed creating a confusing array of conflicting pedestrian crossings adjacent to the raised table streetbed there is insufficient room for traffic headed east bound on columbia rd that is turning left to go north on 16th street there is room for 2 or 3 cars at the light and thats it perhaps that should not be allowed the raised table roadbed provides for crossing the diagonal from the atf to the metro entrance the large pedestrian crossing area needs to be better delineated to inform drivers of the wide pedestrian zone there is a stop sign on one side of the pedestrian crossing but is missing on the other side this is confusing dangerous and encourages cars to speed through the very wide pedestrian tablet crossing both sides need a stop sign the wide pedestrian crossing has a stop sign on one side but not the other encouraging drivers to speed through the wide tabletop pedestrian crossing area between the atf and the m street metro entrance south bound 11th street cars frequently blow this red light today witnessed school bus do this not sure if its due to confusion over the light a 12 block ahead at ri ave or just terrible drivers doing terrible things in the morning and evening pedestrian traffic has to wait absurdly long times to cross even when vehicle traffic is at a standstill cars travelling eastbound routinely speed along this section of ny ave the pedestrian signal only appears on demand and there is a long delay between pressing the button and the light changing there is a long wait to cross at this intersection the pedestrian lights take a long time to change even after you press the button it takes a long time for the lights to change on north capitol street this bikelane ends in the middle of nowhere it seems to lead to the sidewalk on the other side of massachusetts avenue the bike lane on first street needs to lead to integrated bike infrastructure pedestrian connectivity on the eastwest corridor is nonexistent cars and large trucks routinely run red lights at this intersection the sidewalk on 1st street is poor between i and h there is not sidewalk on the west side of the street between k and l streets the sidewalk on the east side of the street is in deplorable condition cars routinely run the red light here in both directions speeding and buzzing passing too closewithin inches by silver mercedes this road really needs a bike lane cars routinely block both the crosswalk the bike lane and the intersection on mass ave 15th st creating gridlock and forcing bikers and pedestrians to walkbike around cars that are trying to move cars do not stop on 14th st for pedestrians in crosswalk can the little yellow signs be installed in the center of the street there is a highly elevated bump running across the south bound side of 14th st this is like a speed bump to cars and cyclists it is very hard on the shocks can this be ground down the painted bike lanes disappear between columbia and florida on 14th st many cyclists commute through this area on a daily basis can shared bicycle road symbols be painted through this section to alert drivers to the many cyclists the bike lanes on 11th st ends at monroe many cyclists continue through to spring and then connect to 14th st can shared bike road symbols be painted on spring and 11th between spring14th and 11thmonroe the painted bicycle lanes disappear between florida and columbia on 14th st many cyclists commute here on a daily basis can shared bicycle symbols be painted in this section to alert drivers the metal track running northsouth on 9th is an extremely dangerous hazard for cyclists who risk getting their tires caught in the rut i had an accident on my bicycle bc of this in the evening on november 6 2015 no cars involved there are cars double parked in the bicycle lane when kids are being driven to school cars are driving way over the speed limit especially when headed to mass ave ne bicycle lane abruptly stops at the bike share station when many are trying to get a few feet further north to union station with the number of cars double parked the situation is dangerous there is no crosswalk to get to f st after a long wait everyone just walks where they want to walk to the offices on f st it is a dangerous mess this is on our morning commute to school and every day cars honk at us and scream at us on this block needs a bicycle lane and signage the bike lane gets very narrow and trucks are usually on either side making the sliver where a person on a bike could fit way too narrow and dangerous to use this stretch is full of speeding cars that are going through to md and parents on bikes who live in the neighborhood it needs a protected bike lane desperately bicycle lane ends abruptly on 4th st cars block the bicycle lane here regularly the wait to cross at this intersection is so long that most people end up jay walking there are almost no cars going straight through so it makes no sense that it takes so long to get a full walk sign you get half then the other half tons of k8 students and parents are riding bikes to this school and there is very little signage in the surrounding blocks and the bike lane is unprotected 3 handicap accessible parking spaces are needed on this block why does the street widen right at the intersection of 17 and u it puts pedestrians at risk as they have to walk longer distances theres not much traffic here either this seems like a classic antipedestrian procar design why is this street so wide worst intersection long wait times 2 many out of state drivers do not know what to do because of the poor layout cause traffic jams all day can not make right turn onto florida from ny because the lights are not synchronizeflorida eckington bladensburg rd is a major road out of the city and it is constantly backed up at nysignal problems not a friendly intersection for the kids that attend the school in that area dc295 narrows east capitol to 2 lanes from 3 which forces drivers to remain in the exit only lane for east capitol which backs up the traffic this roadway needs to be widened 2 carry 3 full dc295 travel lanes straight thru 2 dc695 beyond it is very hard to cross minnesota ave at the does bldg going to and frono crosswalk no light and the drivers do not stop this is a major bus hub and women and children and students are trying to cross this roadway its dangerous this roadway was revamped but everyday south dakota is backed up b4 bladensburg rd all because theres no dedicated lane 4 sd to merge into ny u must squeeze 100s of drivers from 2 lanes into 1 lane then into a short merge lane onto ny parents children must cross this service road to get to the pedestrian bridge but the commuter traffic is heavy and is speeding not just on dc295 so the pedestrians are constantly dodging cars speeding into the city to work cars are using the slip ramps from dc295 to exit speed down the service road and reenter the dc295 to beat the traffic other cars ahead of them which does not allow residents to safely exit their neighborhood and get onto dc295 this is a failed intersection delivered by fort meyer construction company that has never worked it has only created my confusion and frustration for neighbors and drivers if you leave parkside the only way you can turn around to head north on dc295 is by using this dangerous turnaround underneath benning rd dc295 horrible intersectiontoo many people buses and cars trying to all cross the same time on overpass needs 2 be created so drivers dont have near misses w pedestrians that are trying 2 catch their bus by darting into traffic 2 work or school i just saw another two drivers blow through this stop sign without even slowing down its across from coolidge high school and near the rec center and playgroundlets make our streets safe for our kids by calming and enforcing laws on 5th st these young kids are speeding in their fancy cars drivers making a right from new hampshire onto 21st often block the bike lane and rarely use blinkers to indicate their intent to turn i have witnessed multiple instances of drivers ignoring the one waydo not enter signs and driving the wrong way down s st between 20th and connecticut the corner of nash anacostia avenue ne wdc blocking entrance because lights are not synchronized light does not have enough time due to the amount of traffic please provide safe bike crossing optionsand bike lanes connecting from 4th st to q st down to noma drivers here absolutely refuse to stop for people walkingthey treat piney branch like a highway we need markings signage zebra crossings and narrower lanes here and we need it fast a pedestrian sidewalk is needed on the 4205 4209 4213 anacostia avenue north east wdc need block parking spaces and one handicapped space in the odd side of 4200 block of anacostia avenue ne washington dc too much traffic issues and going over the solid lines when coming off 695 to 295n why is there no crosswalk on the north side of this intersection this is an antipedestrian antisafety policy why does this right turn lane exist its a waste of space and encourages cars to fly up to o street the road widens here for no reason if anything the road should narrow at an intersection so pedestrians are less at risk the road widens right at the intersection this is antpedestrian the road widens at the intersection this is anti pedestrians when i leave the deanwood metro 2 use the pedestrian bridge 2 cross over kenilworth the cars wont stop are constantly speeding we have 2 dodge cars its always a race can i beat the car not playing chicken all just want 2 get home safely as i and others have previously mentioned cars are constantly parking in the bike lane the district appears to not care about traffic safety so maybe it will help to consider the ticket revenue that enforcement could bring in this isnt gon na make it roads should narrow not widen at intersections this wide intersection is antipedestrian unnecessary left turn arrow cycle from nb 16th st causes delay and congestion missing left turn arrow signal from pole at nw corner of intersection leads pedestrians and drivers to be confused about when the left turn cycle is active pedestrians ignore or do not notice crosswalk signal across alley cars speed out of allegro garage without looking or yeilding to alley or sidewalk traffic its easy to feel squeezed by moving traffic and buses while riding a bike here havent yet been hit but feels likely bataan st nw intersects massachusetts ave nw thus providing a legal yet unmarked crosswalk pedestrians have the right of way to cross here but drivers will never yield without the crosswalk being painted according to the law 16th and o nw provide a legal pedestrian crossing please paint the crosswalk across 16th and adjust the concrete median to allow disabled pedestrians to cross safely drivers run this stop sign without looking for people crossing the street very very dangerous corcoran 19th nw is a legal crosswalk but it is not painted please paint a crosswalk across 19th from corcoran this intersection is dangerous for pedestrians vehicles and bikers alike pedestrians coming out of farragut north ignore signals when crossing k street it makes it impossible to make a legal right turn from the west side of the square onto k street ive been in an accident here caused by a pedestrian so much conflict for people on bikes here with people driving cars we really need a bike land and some separation to make this safer for everyone i have trouble with stopsign running some from people on bikes and some from people in cars north and southbound traffic is well beyond the 25mph limit this is even a trafficcalming zone there are also two schools and a wellused park here the light at south dakota aveperry stquincy st needs a camera for redlight running there are children and older folks that cross this busy street cars do not care and speed up and down the hill there is no crosswalk here at otis pl and 18th street the city bus drops off kids at both the perry st prep lamb schools and there is no way for them to safely cross the street no crosswalk residents have repeatedly asked for a crosswalk here only to be denied what is taking so long the e2 and other buses stop here and there is no safe way to cross 18th the cars come too quickly over the hill and it is hard to cross here the hill hides the traffic an extremely dangerous uncontrolled crosswalk attempting to walk west bound to arlington cemetery you need to cross this highway multiple lanes of highway traffic need to stop at the same time in order to cross drivers exiting the apartment building here do not look for pedestrians when making a rightonred they only look left i am nearly hit very often when walking past drivers routinely cut the wrong way through the slip lane here it is meant to be oneway from eastbound n st nw onto new york ave nw but drivers on inbound new york ave turn here to access n street ive had a dozen close calls here over the years drivers on northbound new jersey ave nw very often skip a red light at n st nw by using the 3rd st nw rump here to turn left on n and right back onto nj generally they dont stop at the n st stop sign lots of close calls for peds crossing 3rd drivers northbound on first st ne often run the stop sign at n st ne it happens most frequently when a shuttle bus or other large vehicle is blocking the stop sign the decorative crosswalk is not enough of a cue in this situation no pedestrian signal for peds crossing in front of navy hill entrance off of 23rd st nw many close calls when navy hill autos have green light they may not always look for peds car veered into cyclist in bike lane knocking him down and driving off angle of road shift may contribute marginally to this issuedrivers going straight without adjusting will drive into bike lane daily double parking in the afternoons westbound forces drivers buses and cyclists to need to move into left lane to go around drivers on georgia make turns onto kansas southbound at high speeds without signalling we should add a curb extension here so that the turn angle is sharper and encourages drivers to slow down and check for people walking before blowing through drivers on massachusetts ave rarely yield to pedestrians crossing massachusetts at 10th street especially dangerous in the winter when its dark during rush hour cabs make illegal uturns here crossing into the bike lanes a cab almost hit me while i was in the bike lane there is an excessively large speed bump in front of 5002 hayes st ne that damages vehicles this building is no longer a school and the speed bump should be removed one of the stop signs at the 3 way intersection is missing cars turning right from 13th st onto v st frequently turn into bike lane this encourages fast driving in front of school and playground when children are present need cars to slow down and turn widerthink road marking or curb to show turn path the crosswalks are poorly timed one ends while the other still has 1020 seconds left and drivers think they have the rightofway even while pedestrians still have the signal to cross drivers do not stop for pedestrians in the only marked crosswalk at this intersection part of the issue may be that people are allowed to park right next to the crosswalk although really if a drivers vision is obscured they should slow down pedbike path on bridge is way too narrow and lacks real separation from traffic because high speed traffic is so loud cant hear bikes approaching from behind this intersection could benefit from something as simple as painting and temporary planters as a type of chicane to slow traffic down there is a serious need to delineate clearly where cars should not block and where they are not supposed to be this intersection at the very minimum needs a stop sign on sb 8th street watching for cars from the north is impossible dream scenario the intersection has a traffic light to also sync with k street and 8th streets or the triangle is closed 2 cars there is no sidewalk andor ramp that allows people with strollers wheelchairs etc to safely cross massachusetts ave cars routinely ignore the do not enter signs during rush hour cars routinely ignore the do not enter signs on 12th st during rush hour bike lane frequently blocked here by dc police cars intersection of 45th river and fessenden remains hazardous for pedestrians there needs to be targeted crosswalk enforcement here and more use of speed cameras there should be streetlight at the intersection of 7th street swva ave sw i bike home via this route and this is immediately south of the railroad bridge and there is a slight elevation decrease for vehicles traveling south on 7th st there is a one way alley between harrison garrison streets just east of 44th street nw vehicles are permitted to travel only south to north from garrison to harrison streets however vehicles frequently travel illegally from north to south commuters block the street in the am rush hours very busy pedestrian crosswalk at the ihop cars dont slow down or stop for pedestrians a signal at this intersection would be nice local traffic on stanton rd has to wait a long time to cross suitland parkway even during periods of light traffic on the parkway especially on weekends and holidays there is no lead time for pedestrians to cross mlk onto the 11th street bridge sidewalk cars come flying from good hope road and very few pause to allow pedestrians or cyclists to cross with the light multiple vehicles routinely drive down the street through the crosswalk at a highrate of speed stop is heavily used by the disabled seniors and children alike due to it being a popular disembarkation point for the crosstown metrobuses traffic routinely speeds on alaska ave including metro buses delivery trucks park in the bike lane frequently at all times of the day eastbound cars routinely run this light every afternoon usually several for each cycle of the light the city should put a redlight camera at this intersection missouri and 13th nw not obeying no parking times macarthur blvd is popular for recreational cyclists at the bottom of the hill coming from md into dc there are two sewer grates with the openings going in the same direction of the road it would be easy for a cyclist to catch their wheel in this commuters blocking the box in the am rush hrs this is a great intersection for dont block the box program construction vehicles parked near intersections block views for turning traffic cars are constantly going through this stop sign and speeding down fessenden between wisconsin ave and river road there are many small children who live on fessenden street and it is very concerning that cars drive so fast down this street cars always parked in noparking travel lanes force merging and near accidents drivers right turn on red from good hope onto mlk even when there is oncoming traffic with a green light this causes many near accidents and makes it impossible for peds to cross cars drive the wrong way on this oneway street which has a blind turn in it this driveway is used by many cars hoping to utun on good hope road they do not yield to cyclists or pedestrians on the sidewalk people park along good hope road and some double park here which completely blocks the flow of traffic all parking on ghr should be banned during rush hours the trolley tracks are insufficiently covered and the pavement is breaking down which leads to serious problems in the pavement there is no lead time between the pedestrians and cars so that one has to hope people on ghr dont turn right into you when you are crossing with the light speeding is a big issue here drivers speed off of wisconsin avenue onto 41st there is a cross walk right at this intersection i live on this block of 41st and people drive way too fast stop sign or camera is needed here to calm traffic consistently see people going up 41st street nw through the do not enter pedestrians frequently walk between cars and are in lanes when lights are against them pedestrians frequently cross street not at corner and against lights four way stop sign needed at 43rd place and brandywine no one stops for the cross walk and it is treacherous chronic speeding on warren street between 46th and mass ave many children and other pedestrians at risk this intersection has multiple problems cars crossing 46th on fessenden can not see cars on 46th due to onstreet parking cars also can not see pedestrians trying to cross there should be a stop sign on 46th taxis frequently block the crosswalks without a care to anyone walking there is a yieldtopedestrians sign at 42nd if youre driving toward wisconsin on fessenden it is routinely ignored especially when drivers are in a hurry to make the light ridge place is horribly torn up with previous repairs whole of street needs replacement the sidewalk is so torn up here since the removal of a covered bus stop that people are not able to safely wait for the bus without impeding traffic on the sidewalk this is prob md dot but pls forward this when turning left into western ave from wisconsin circle the left lane almost at the traffic light on western has the same sinkhole starting again its been patched 2x but needs more thoro work on it northbound stretch cars coming from ben banneker park buzzed me at high speed many times extremely dangerous for bikes find it safer to go north on the other side into oncoming traffic uhaul frequently allows customers to park trucks in a way that completely blocks sidewalk and forces bikes into street they need to be ticketed this intersection is a deadly unholy mess during pm rush hour ok for bikers actually but just a deathtrap for commuters trying to get home i live on this intersection and have had more close calls than i can count from drivers heading eastbound on ri turning left onto n capitol this intersection is very dangerous for pedestrians cars speed along this street through a residential neighborhood there needs to be a stop sign for traffic on nevada because there are very poor sight lines for cars on morrison trying to cross nevada stopping seems to be optional i saw a parking enforcement employee zoom down 47th st and take a left onto warren st without even slowing down drivers run stop signs and speed regularly on this block during rush hour cars cut down warren to escape traffic on massachusetts several call shave been made to 311 over past 6 months re horrible pavement on yuma between 48th and 46th please fix before winter sets in cars use this as stopping area during am commuting thereby blocking lane of traffic for cars attempting to exit l and r onto mass ave coming out of 42nd st and trying to turn either right or left can take awhile as theres little visibility causing an angry line of cars to build up behind you at this school intersection and surrounding blocks cars do not obey 15mph school speed very congested area with many children present i live on this street near intersection with small children and find people running this stop sign constantly failure to yield to traffic in circle mostly coming from the the north on connecticut avenue parking permitted on east side of river road and short green light going north during am rush ensure back ups on 46th st and river rd regularly pedestrians fail to yield right of way cross against dont walk signs to cars turning with green arrow from nb wisconsin west to jenifer 35mph speed limit only a few feet from a yield sign into a busy traffic circle the speed limit for the final approach to the circle should be closer to 15mph right ne corner of river rd and fessenden needs one of those signs that says no parking from here to corner a big suv habitually parks about 4 feet from the corner and not only makes it difficult to see traffic but also makes it difficult to turn r dangerous heavily traveled intersection with a four way stop i recommend flashing lights to warn drivers of the stop and presence of pedestrians cars regularly run this red light long after it has turned red i live right next door to to this intersection and there have been a lot of near misses its not a four way stop but people assume it is so lots of honking screeching of horns occasional accidents cars make illegal turn onto 43rd st northwest during restricted hours cars parked too close to the entrance of the alley during times when parking is allowed on nebraska its not possible to see cars on nebraska moving towards washington circle cars trying to make a left turn from van ness onto nebraska cause major jams on the intersection between 42nd st and van ness there should be a four way stop at this intersection it is extremely dangerous for cars crossing van ness even when the way appears clear cars making quick turns from nebraska onto van ness have almost hit me several times the walkdont walk signal is facing the wrong way and isnt visible to pedestrians trying to cross ellicott on the west side of wisconsin going north cars race down warren st during am and pm commute putting residents and children at risk people run this stop sign all the time almost hitting drivers and pedestrian shorter time during rush hour just when more people actually need to cross just yesterday i watched a driver looking at his phone blow right through a red to turn right onto m from 21st didnt even slow down drivers often turn northwest from 42nd street to river and come very close to pedestrians including school kids heading to janney es it doesnt help that there are no walkdontwalk electronic signs for pedestrians crossing northsouth on the east we need no more stop signs here there is no problem with visibility just bad drivers there are way too many so people run them because they are frustrated they have to stop every single block ridiculous and it creates an emissions nightmare no need for stop sign maybe a cross traffic doesnt stop sign stop signs are overused and ignored lane markings in westmoreland circle always seem to be nearly invisible annual restriping is called for here to reduce confusion and enhance safety drivers turn from river to go east on cheseapeake and either dont see pedestrians or see them but come very close to them sidewalk has been broken for over a year i have called dot about 20 times and they give me due dates for completion and then nothing happens heavy congestion and unsafe conditions during lafayette elementary dropoff and pickup times there are hundreds of people cars and trucks on this street at these times and it is unsafe for the many children walking and crossing the street there is a crosswalk at conn and jocelyn that is routinely ignored crossing here is extremely dangerous as cars speed down conn ave vehicles on 4th street and m in northbound right lane direction have a blind spot and can not see pedestrians standing on the corner of m st heading the westbound direction due to the turret navy yard brick wall the confusing intersection of nebraska ave 30th place and mckinley st often results in stop sign running by cars entering this intersection cars always pick up coming down this hill and then zoom up the hill on military road the pedestrian signal at this intersection never seems to allow pedestrians to cross 5th street crosswalk before circle incomplete crosswalk sign is obscured by tree confusing signs 25mph 15mph close proximity cars speed over 25mph cars dont use circles properlya camera would show many speedsters many school children walk this way the sidewalks are too narrow to handle the crowds i would like to see this area converted into a more pedestrian friendly spot where driving is minimized through the area during the weekends drivers frequently speed up and down wisconsin avenue and treat it like a highway cars rarely stop for pedestrians at this crosswalk i am typically crossing with my young children cars traveling on 16th st do not give cyclists space i have been nearly run off the road by cars trying to pass within the same lane without moving to the next lane this is with a child trailer behind me which is clearly visible this should be a fourway stop visibility isnt great and drivers unfamiliar with the area always stop as if it were fourway locals gun down garrison oblivious to the many little kids on the block and pedestrians only 25 seconds to cross seven lanes of traffic on ny ave while on n cap all the while cars are running the light and trying to turn while you are crossing i work on 19th and there isnt a good commuting route to work from the memorial bridge 23rd street is narrowed by the state dept barracades 21st doesnt go through 18th is jammed 15th is too far need a nb route from the mall for bike commuters i bike commute down 19th to the mall there is no decent alternative but the ride on 19th is treacherous traffic is too fast and inconsiderate turning traffic at e street and at constitution is dangerous and there isnt a good lane for cyclists cars parked too close to alley entrance block visibility very difficult to see cars when entering 49th st should be no parking from alley entrance to north of fire hydrant cars parked too close to alley block visibility difficult to enter 49th st should have a no parking zone 5 or 10 feet south of intersection buses speed though and will honk at people getting out of their cars rather than slowing down tailgating is also a problem if traveling at the speed limit aggressive drivers will speed around cars they feel are going too slow vehicle routinely speed and run through this intersection after the light has already changed both during the morning and evening rush hours this section of the road is in extremely poor condition frequently putting bikers and drivers into oncoming traffic to avoid the heavy potholes drivers often use this as a shortcut to south capitol and greatly exceed the 20 mph speed limit this threatens the high number of bicyclists and pedestrians that use the park the parking makes belt road the stretch of fort reno too narrow cars run the gauntlet speeding through because they have to take turns with cars going the other direction and no pedestrian crosswalk which is much needed incomplete sidewalk please do not remove this stop sign we need it no sidewalks drives can not see speed limit clearly police say they can not enforce speed limit downhill because markings not clear enough no sidewalk unsafe to walk missing sidewalk turning south from penn ave onto 28th st there is often not enough space especially when cars are parked both sides of 28th and traffic waiting to enter penn ave from 28th parking should not be allowed on 28th so close to penn ave particularly during mornings 89am with young children walking to school needs slow children at play sign heavy traffic diverts off military into the neighborhood and at least 12 kids live within this block cars routinely block the crosswalk making it unsafe for pedestrian and bicyclists in general this intersection is poorly designed for how high traffic is has become as the neighborhood has added more restaurants and entertainment venues no way to cross pennsylvania ave minn ave is too far to walk too much traffic heading east from fairlawn ave cross penn ave to get to ramp to northbound anacostia frwy very dangerous and traffic clogging many cars speed down 49th st to try to make light at 49th and mass this is a major crosswalk to get to the spring valley shopping center and lots of kids live in the area we need a 4 way stop or other type of traffic calming measure issues w cars speeding along irving st to connect to the hospital centers irving st is a major thoroughfare and attracts speeding during day time and night time traffic many senors and families live along the 400700 block of irving st many cars travelling south on connecticut fail stop for pedestrians despite crossing signs the cross walk on ellicott seems to be just below the crest of a small hill speeding cars dont necessarily see a pedestrian until they are at xwalk cars regularly and significantly exceed the speed limit to make the light at 42nd st and albermarle this is especially dangerous given the proximity to janney es i live on this block it is not a secret euclid has become a thoroughfare instead of a residential street due to the traffic design in this area cars routinely speed here to make the light on 14th id like to see speed bumps installed running the gauntlet flow is usually nearing 2x posted speed limit with sudden stops by drivers trying to force their way into line to continue n on beach i avoid this intersection like the plague because no one obeys the posted signs the one block of 2 way traffic on a very tight road creates confusion for bikers who must be pushed onto the sidewalk or weave through traffic eliminate parking on one side of the street to add extra space for vehicular traffic the dog leg and double signal confuses drivers some stop some dont driving eastwest on fairmont makes no sense at this intersection people driving on nebraska fail to stop at the stop signs at 30th pl and mckinley st and fail to yield to pedestrians trying to cross nebraska people are speeding through alleys to avoid am dropoff traffic at lafayette elementary school also people are parking in alley entrances blocking the sidewalks and not paying enough attention to pedestrians cars coming down harvard frequently blow through the stop sign going south the intersection is too wide because it looks like an old streetcar turnaround i would like to see some rainscaping to replace some of the empty pavement traffic back up cars speeding not stopping for pedestrians cutting through alleys parking in alleys turning around in the middle of the street to get out of the traffic during lafayette drop off pick up times agree with other comment about the terrible pavement quality its hazardous to ride on suggest also making a contraflow bike lane on this block it would be a key linkage to ontario rd to the south many cyclists already ride against traffic here car 2 go smartcars are being left in no parking zoneslanes during rush hour creating dangerous passing and traffic back up issues cyclist regularly fly down the sidewalk and pedestrians have to jump out of the way drivers always continue straight through the left turn only lane this is problematic when lane 2 also a left turn lane tries to turn left old ebbitt grill valet parking can at times occupy all n bound travel lanes people driving on nebraska run the stop signs at 30th pl and mckinley st routinely and fail to yield to pedestrians trying to cross nebraska 23 seconds to cross eight lanes of traffic on 1st st across rhode island the road is blocked due to construction at lafayette schools and cars and clogging the streets parking in alleys double parking etc drivers constantly use this private parking garage entrance to make u turns on albemarle st they drive quickly into the curb cut blocking the sidewalk and threatening the pedestrians going tofrom the metro right in front of a school cars can exit the circle from the inner lane or can stay in the circle from the middle or outer lanes creating frequent opportunities for accidents lanes should be marked so cars are not crossing each other the stop signs do not work during rush hour the cars barely stop and pedestrians are in danger attempting to cross independence ave and the 10th st cross traffic is unclear about when they can go drivers frequently fail to stop for pedestrians in the cross walk speed trucks routinely trave illegally over 125ton capacity vnren mpd will ticket periodically but they do have more important things to do we need speed an truck cameras as recommended in recent ddot van ness street traffic calming report cyclists are really aggressive in this stretch of 11th street particularly at the u street traffic signal as a bicyclist ive frequently felt endangered by the behavior of other cyclists maybe signal timing could be changed to work better for all drivers are double parking parking illegally disregarding traffic patterns blocking crosswalks during am drop off at lafayette elementary school traffic and pedestrian volume along with illegally parked vehicles and drivers disobeying traffic rules during am drop off at lafayette elementary school make walking and driving very dangerous drivers wishing to enter nevada at this junction with morrison struggle visibility is poor often pulling out into traffic honestly there should be a stop sign on nevada here as painful as it is to add another stop sign to nevada cars turning from quarry onto 18th often blow through the stop sign and create hazardous conditions for drivers peds and bikes cars speed on university terrace nw all the time they treat is as a cut through from loughboro to macarthur someone is going to get killed if the cars do not slow down they also do not stop at stop sign at corner of university and loughboro there is a crosswalk in this location that does not have stop signs around it frequently cars are parked illegally around the crossing too making it very difficult to be seen when stepping into the cross walk cars zoom right through drivers routinely park in the posted noparking zone in front of broad branch market because there seems to be no enforcement there seems to be no incentive for drivers to follow the rules either enforce the rules or remove the parking prohibition drivers drive well above the speed limit on 30th pl which has multiple bus lines and many families with children i live at 5707 33rd street nw and there are huge traffic problems including parking in crosswalks speeding running stop signs and clogged streets due to pickup and drop off at lafayette school during the renovation drivers constantly use the one way street to make u turns on albemarle st despite the one way sign and the no u turn sign cars will illegally pull into the one way street where many pedestrians must cross in order to get tofrom the metro station kids cross the street at this intersection to get to school but drivers often speed through the stop sign the bike lane in the block of 9th st between f and g st is called the suicide lane since oftentimes buses and cars drive right down the middle of that lane making it very dangerous for bikes needs much more enforcement of boundaries there is too much going on at this intersection the other traffice lane a crosswalk and several bus stops close the section of wv ave between k st and 8th will allow for a safe intersection as cars will be directed by the traffic light at 8th on k between 8th and florida there is no need for a double lane in the evening rush hour in this residential area allow cars to park could encourage drivers to slow down to the proper speed limit as they would not consider it a highway most resident double park on this section of road as it is impossible to park close to our house h st customers and evening rush hour towing rob us of parking on fl and k we have to double park to unload grocery and kids then park 4 blocks away this bike path is a joke the hill is too steep please make the path going along the train tracks and connecting to the fort totten stationpark through 1st st this would encourage people to use their bikes there is no sidewalk on s dakota between madison and nh so we walk on the street not really safe please add a sidewalk in fort circle park so we can access the nh bridge safely the sidewalk needs to be wider to allow strollers and wheelchairs to use it on the bridge there is unused space on both sides of the lanes that could be used to do that also add a barrier between the sidewalk and the street to help us feel safer sela pcs is right there kids are around yet cars are going fast and do not stop there is double parking etc the entire block needs to be reevaluated with this children population in mind please meet with the school staff and residents a sidewalk is needed on this section of oneida st ne we are walking on the road yet there is plenty of space for 2 way traffic and a proper sidewalk there is currently no proper marking on the road so if feels like an alley residents are complaining that they can not find parking parents from sela complain that they are having a hard time dropping off their kids please work with residents and sela pcs staff to find a solution that can work and keep kids safe cars from 1st going west on riggs seem to forget that pedestrians are crossing they speed and there has been some very close calls a school is just up the road and the metro right there pedestrian safety is a major issue on riggs there is no sidewalk on both sides of this section of the street this is not acceptable right next to a school walking in the street with a stroller or being in wheelchair is to dangerous there is no protection for the bike rack located in the street cars often hit our bike wheels and we have to replace these as a result it is not used to its full extent add a concrete wall or something to protect the bikes and pedestrians the sidewalk on both side of the street is in desperate need of fixing the lack of action so far may be due to it being next to low income housing and a retirement home but we all deserve safe access there is no sidewalk on blair road in some areas and those present are not wide enough this is the shortest and flattest access to some of the schools on kansas from the takoma station make it safe for our kids continue the bike trail along the metro tracks the hill up to hawaii is impossible to use as a cyclist the flatter the better so following the metro would be great i am sure something could be figured out for the transfer station please mark the bike lane so cyclists know where they are to ride on the sidewalk or on the street if on the street add some protection for the cyclist horace and dickies seafood is a hot spot people double park park in the alley etc to get their seafood fix please find a solution and enforce parking here also cleaning the area would be appreciated the sidewalks are disgusting if you want us to use this bike lane redo the road mark it in green and put it between the sidewalk and the parked cars to keep us protected from the speeding traffic this bike lane needs to be longer then half a block to be used if you want us to use this bike lane redo the road mark it in green and put it between the sidewalk and the parked cars to keep us protected from the speeding traffic vehicles turning onto riggs rd are not paying any attention to pedestrians riggs rd is considered a highway for marylanders and their is no consideration for the kids and parents going to the school located right there we ride on the sidewalk as it is absolutely insane to ride on the street under the bridge please add a bike lane connecting the 1st st bike lane and the i st section the sidewalk on the western side is impossible to use with a wheelchair or a stroller roots and bumps as well as it not being wide enough make it impossible to use north capitol really feels like a highway for marylanders to go fast the rental place sunbelt uses the street as a private loading dock for their trucks it needs to change as it is a hazard to pedestrians biles and cars there is a school and a disabled adult center right here cars park in the blocked out areas on the street make it a parking spot or make it part of the sidewalks any unused space on the street will be used to stop and park unless you put a physical obstacle i ride on the sidewalks as the bike lane is not protected from cars i refuse to ride on a bike lane like that with kids on my bike put obstacles so cars do not end up in the bike lane and i will ride there construction crews have monopolized parking and driving space on this residential block impeded access to the alley where many residents have offstreet parking and have hit and damaged parked cars including my own with their heavy equipment drivers turning onto ramp onto i395 s often do not stop for pedestrians in this crosswalk which has pedestrian signals but no crosswalk markings on pavement pedestrian crossing signals at the various crosswalks at this intersection often given very confused countdowns 99 98 97 6 5 4 or just taxi drivers often make illegal uturns at this intersection from wb c st to eb c st so they can go into the taxi stand at the corner by the holiday inn additionally crosswalks are frequently blocked by more taxis than fit in the taxi stand there are schools with kids and the crosswalk is not clearly marked please add a stop sign on chillum and remark the crosswalk there is no way anyone can safely cross at the three crosswalks before and after the nh bridge speeding and poor visibility is the issue please add raised crosswalks and signs to force cars to slow down and stop to pedestrians tuning left from rittenhouse on kansas is very dangerous as there are cars parked too close to the intersection and blocking the visibility for drivers cars dont stop unless they are forced too by the school cross guard who is present only for a few hours that is unacceptable and is a recurring issue on riggs road not good with a school right there a pedestrian access to chillum place would be great the only other access currently is on the nh bridge which is a highway where cars speed without consideration for pedestrians drivers including metrobus operators and other bus drivers intent on making the light routinely fail to yield to pedestrians crossing the nwbound half of pennsylvania ave cars turning right from penn onto 6th st routinely ignore or can not see pedestrians crossing northwest with the green signal i walk this route daily and am nearly hit at least once a week an electrical box conceals crossing pedestrians drivers turning left onto 395n ramp often do not stop for pedestrians who have a walk signal this crosswalk is not marked at all there are too many lanes of traffic to cross at once this street feels terrifying especially as a visitor who is unfamiliar with dc drivers as a visitor who recognizes that many of the drivers may also be visitors and not familiar with dc motorists can only turn right on to n cap from patterson st north this is a feeder lane so they only look to their left for oncoming traffic and many do not take the stop sign very seriously meanwhile pedestrians are walking south there is serious repeated running of this stop sign which is next to a school crossing and pedestrian walk way a camera is needed to prevent an accident or death crossing vermont is unsafe due to cars flying down sherman onto vermont with no visibility of pedestrians incredibly unsafe to get from v st to the new development at atlantic plumbing lack of 4way stop at this intersection is unique among all i st ne intersections between here and 2nd st and makes it tough for bicyclists and pedestrians as cars tend to speed through here trying to make the very short lights at florida or h cars tend to speed along 13th st ne between florida ave and h st to try to make the very short lights at both and because there is no stop sign at i st ne they often reach unsafe speeds for bicyclists and pedestrians in this area cars tend to speed along 13th st ne to try to make the very short lights at h st ne they often reach unsafe speeds for bicyclists and pedestrians in this area cars frequently block the crosswalk here on the south side of h st due to the short light time for 13th st cars going straight often are left unable to cross and in the crosswalk and cars trying to turn right on red also often block the crosswalk from 3 am to 530 am 6wheeler trucks high speed on river rd going in direction of wisconsin ave earth shakes and house vibrates dangerous for residents and residences also puts city sewer and water lines under river rd at risk of cracking six wheeler trucks travel at high speed between 3530 am on river rd going toward wisconsin ave earth and homes shake dangerous for people and properties also makes underground city water and sewer lines under river rd vulnerable to cracking drives often fail to stop at stop sign cars driving west drive dangerously close to cars parked on the side of street due to double yellow line in road even when no cars are coming the other direction cars run stop signs stop sign needed here this intersection is a disaster each evening rush hour the lights arent time correctly and cars block the crosswalks and the box constantly as cars line up to turn left onto mass ave from 7th ave headed north sidewalk on 17th street next to the renwick is broken and not level ive witnessed multiple trips and falls by pedestrians traffic congestion at the 4way stop during morning rush is dangerous heavy commuter traffic on 1st plus traffic on r is exacerbated by no left turn at florida conditions will worsen when 1st st reopens north of rhode island there are few intersections to cross north capitol in this area need more time and it shouldnt require a beg button also box and crossing are often blocked randolph place nw is too narrow for trucks and buses need signage to limit over sized vehicles danger to all to have vehicles unable to pass on street forcing someone to back up long block there is a charter school on this block and its quite difficult for cars to both park and pass through during morning dropoff time between 815 845 with kids coming through the areas it seems dangerous for pedestrians and rife for car accid cars zoom through the yield sign at the entrance to the traffic circle and there are no sidewalks here so pedestrians runners dogwalkers and kids are on the street at this spot often this intersection is terrifying to cross as a pedestrian there are two lanes of traffic crossing the crosswalk and no light to stop cars barreling through the circle i sprint through it and pray each time its a horrible accident waiting to happe sidewalk is too narrow for pedestrians and bikers please make a safe protected path here this is an important connector between georgetown and the capital crescent trail cars drive very fast despite the 25 mph speed limit residential street and school directly across the street i worry for the safety of the school children this is a narrow street with lots of pedestrian traffic there are a least three schools on a 2 street stretch despite this cars zoom by this morning while biking north on 4th st between m and i sts sw there were 4 separate cars illegally parked and blocking the bike lane there appears to be absolutely no attempt at parking enforcement here shameful speeding on randolph place unit block especially from and to the light crossing with n capitol intersection has become unbearable it needs to be turned into a oneway and speeding must be enforced by undercover officers to flag down violators this little triangular traffic island is massively undersigned it has been reported several times to ddot that there needs to be signage to warn eastbound fla ave traffic of this hardtosee island and the oneway traffic after it on fla cars trvling s on n cap using randolph place as a cutthrough to avoid traffic turns are made by cars blocking the box or just after the light and so are done at hight speed making it very dangerous for peds at this crosswalk one way or no turns very dangerous highspeed and sideswiping problems on randolph as more and more commuters use randolph place nw as a shortcut to avoid delays on 1st andor north capitol must be oneway going to n cap from west to east too much twoway traffic on randolph vehicles trying to squeeze by each other and clipping cars and even bikers very dangerous narrow roadway should be residential only and definitely one way also too often cars doubleparking many small accid randolph pl unit block nw has significant speeding issues it is too narrow to support fast twoway commuter traffic that cuts thru the roadway from n capitol to 1st st on randolph place should really be oneway going east just like ne blk traffic in both directions very dangerous to our young children and also our handicapped neighbor who has a dedicated parking spot and a hard time parking when people speed down from north capitol going west please make 1way randolph place suffers from significant and too frequent doubleparking with sideswipes and drivers blowing horns at each other as a result police more and make one way on the north side of massachusetts there is no ramp to allow those with accessibility issues to cross over massachusetts i cross the street here every weekday almost daily i see cars running the red light not just trying to beat the yellow this is blatantly running the red light when i have a walk sign already and cars from 21st start moving then they yell at me cars drive too fast up and down wisconsin here i cross the street here every weekday almost daily i see cars running the red light not just trying to beat the yellow this is blatantly running the red light when i have a walk sign already very dangerous for cyclists im at this intersection every weekday evening almost daily drivers will run the red light andor block the box this is less severe than on 19th and k im at this intersection every weekday evening cars on k run the light without fear of enforcement many days intersection is completely blocked there are some cycles when not a single car can get through in the southern direction towards i st i can get to speed above the speed limit here and drivers still fly by me not very safe drivers on e street consistently run red lights and probably go over the speed limit while doing it cars turning right onto kstreet coming down from 15th regularly try to cross the bike lane to turn right putting cyclists lives at risk or blocking the lane cars frequently drive through the crosswalk even when the light is red and pedestrians are attempting to cross via the crosswalk tour buses delivery trucks taxis and federal government workers extremely often park in the bike lane on g st here sometimes many of them in a row cars frequently ignore the red no turn signal and attempt to turn left onto 23rd from m even when pedestrians crossing 23rd have the right of way cars turn left from m street onto 23rd even when the turn signal is red and pedestrians are in the crosswalk i am an old resident of this neighborhood have been severely affected by the sudden increase in traffic on this block of randolph place r and s streets are 15x as wide and see less traffic than randolph place something must be done here many accidents and fatalities happen on irving and park pl people use this strip for drag racing creative calming measure are needed due to ddot restrictions on irving re snow emergency route major bus lane and major gateway to the hospital centers creative traffic calming measures are needed due to columbia being a major bus route and other restrictions cracked sidewalks speeding cars around curb near bus stop in front of childrens hospital limited parking due to hospital staff illegally parking in residential zones and limited enforcement traffic backs up on irving every morning during weekdays due to parents illegally parking during no parking hours to drop off their children at the child care center at 424 irving the 500 and 600 blocks on irving are merged into one long block there anew many seniors and parents with young children who cross the street to get to their cars and often interface with speeding cars no bike lanes or lines indicating street lanes long blocks and speeding cars negativity affect many senior pedestrians licing along this block no truck restrictions on very narrow street with tight turn flanked by parked cars regularly hit and run damage and stucktruck backups impromptu entrance into 295 from benning road need a merging lane from river terrace to 295 there are 2 merging lane and it is often difficult to see the cars that are entering 295 and the ones that are entering benning road it is dangerous ive seen many residents in wheelchairs and walkers that can not cross safely in the amount of time allotted for pedestrian safety and while i like the brick crosswalk it does make it difficult for those in walkers to move smoothly i cross here as a pedestrian every weekday i would estimate one out of every 30 cars stops when im waiting to cross today i got halfway across but cars going the other direction wouldnt stop so i was stranded in the middle of georgia ave car drivers rarely stop for pedestrians in designated cross walk and show little interest in slowing down almost very time i try to cross at this corner which is many times a week someone runs the stop sign and isnt even looking for pedestrians this is right outside cfsa and its one thing for me to get hurt but there are a lot of children here cars often take a shortcut through this alley to circumvent traffic on m st and fly through it ive almost been hit on the sidewalk here a few times they then turn into the right lane and dangerously merge to get into the tunnel as mentioned here i have nearly been hit by speeding cars no less than 4 times while attempting to cross at this crosswalk cars routinely speed between the stop lights at colorado and decatur and rarely heed signs to stop for pedestrians it is not safe to cross here sidewalk is too narrow to bike across safely barrier between speeding traffic is less than a foot tall not safe sidewalks needed between sousa bridge and minnesota ave giant sinkhole has been here since at least 2011 someday someone will run right into it currently covered by plywood dangerous passing by cars is common they will also often yell at me to get off the roadway cars tend to take this right hand turn without coming to a full stop and expect to be able to take a right on red i broke 4 ribs because a car failed to give the right of way to the crosswalk turn is too shallow cars go too fast sidewalk connection across the benning csx bridge is narrow and full of sharp bumps pedestrian signal takes forever to change and cars do fail to stop consistently curb ramps are narrow outdated and likely not up to compliance no way to cross benning beyond jaywalking through 8 lanes of traffic build pedestrian infrastructure going east from the benning bridge to the intersection the bridge dumps you in a weird place in the intersection with roads on both sides sketchy island needs improved pedestrian infrastucture possible to do a barnes dance at this intersection there is no crosswalk to the sw corner over georgia so it takes a lot of effort to get to that corner bad for those businesses on ga south of missouri hard for wb peds from missouri there are lots of older congregants attending services at the churches across the street the cross light only lasts for 35 seconds not enough time for someone with mobility challenges traffic going ne on south dakota speeds through this corridor very dangerous with schools here and children present i have to cross this street on foot with my children to get to turkey thicket there is a pedestrian crossing but traffic is too fast and heavy and often does not stop we need a traffic light here or some other enforcement this intersection needs to better facilitate bicyclists turning from monroe onto 8th and vice versa this is a major route for cyclists accessing the mbt but navigating the traffic and turns here leads to dangerous scenarios for both cars and bikes cars driving east on park often turn right and drive the wrong way on warder street there are small oneway signs but they are small and not very visible two large wrong way signs on either side of warder at this intersection would help cyclists almost always ignore the red light with the picture of a bicycle on it despite the fact that its clear intended for cyclists pedestrians constantly jaywalk on this stretch of road even when there is a crosswalk right next to them they are incapable of staying in the crosswalk cars turning right onto g st from 9th street north often fail to come to a complete stop this is particularly bad during morning rush hour no sidewalks along this traffic island forcing pedestrians to take a circuitous route to walk down the west side of 9th street no indication that the right lane of 395n becomes an exit only lane to 12th st drivers are frequently caught unaware and try to merge late often causing traffic delays crossing ny ave at n cap is one of the more terrifying pedestrian experiences in dc turning vehicles do not yield to peds and make their own second turning lane that doubles the danger for people crossing cars consistently speed up and down street making it completely unsafe for pedestrians sidewalk needed along east side of arkansas ave between 16th and taylor double parking is always an issue on this street it is absurd that there is no direct way to cross to the street car and you have to run across three lanes of traffic on the h street speedway to get there cyclists refuse to pay attention to the stop sign or other pedestrians making this intersection even more dangerous white line needed on the exit to allow crossing of driveway during red light on traffic signal poorly marked crosswalk we need crosswalk lights here is this the worst 100 yards of double parking in the district quite possibly a real testament to the dc city government whose planning office happens to be on this block there is a school here right turns on red should not be allowed here think of the children mayor this intersection has a confusing light for cars traveling west on alabama it goes from red to flashing yellow and cars often ignore both also cars driving north on 4th st through this intersection often dont stop for pedestrians at all cars traveling west on alabama turning right onto 8th st often dont see pedestrians walking on the crosswalk because of phone pole in the way and speeding schoolkids run across the street all the time and almost get hit even with the crossing guard there terrible intersection for pedestrians the green light is short and the wait for it is long theres no crosswalk on the east side of this intersection traffic is always heavy and many cars turn at this intersection there are also many bicyclists and there is a handicapped residential building nearby it is very difficult for pedestrians to cross the street the timed oneway signs on 17th street are not clear enough i see drivers going the wrong way on temporarily oneway 17th street every day and it is terrifying cars regularly cut in front of the bike block as they wait to turn forcing bikes to swerve around them sometimes into oncoming traffic i collided with another bike today as i tried to avoid to cars doing just that very dangerous for cyclists as mentioned previously cars routinely block the route of cyclists on 15th trying to cross k i saw 2 bikes collide this morning trying to avoid 2 cars that blocked passage visibility is poor both for cyclists and motorists at this intersection on numerous occassions vehicles have nearly hit myself and my spouse they have yelled out the window screaming that they have right of way when in reality there are crosswalks and we are already utilizing them there should be a stop sign or light a yield to pedestrians sign would help cars to slow down when approaching the traffic circle there really should be a bike lane on this street many commuters bike down it to get to the vre station at lenfant drivers are very aggressive on this road and sometimes yell at cyclists for taking up their space a bike lane would make it safer people feel compelled to jaywalk here between the johns hopkins building instead of telling pedestrians not to there should be a crosswalk and a yield sign it is absurd to expect people to walk to either end of this long block the makeshift bike lane due to construction on the old washington post building is consistently filled with pedestrians especially during pm rush peds deserve their own safe sidewalk space here so that bikers and peds arent in conflict thank you for the new traffic light and crosswalk here but the light is angled so that eastbound traffic can not see it until almost under neath it ive seen multiple cars running the light here apparently unaware cars going westbound downihll in pm rush hour are still taking both lanes esp at bottom nearat the light despite several signs indicating 2way traffic need more signs nearat the light new flashing lightsign facing eastbound traffic warning about new traffic sign is obscured by bamboo needs trimming back traffic light itself is also a problem see not there westbound macarthur traffic turning left on arizona run light bc there is no dedicated leftturn light they must fight oncoming traffic left turn lane backs up in pm rush hour need dedicated leftturn phase in light cycle cars regularly enter intersection after light has turned red and traffic is stopped thus blocking the box this seems to primarily impact bikers as their lane is blocked first and they are forced to weave around cars or weave into moving traffic this block of columbia road has deep ruts and potholes that make it dangerous for cyclists and drivers could it be repaved this block of columbia road needs to be repaved and crosswalks repainted where they are crumbling and cant be seen after walking south across penn ave there is no longer a crosswalk to cross potomac where it meets penn on the se corner and cars often race through red lights from both penn ave and potomac ave regardless of pedestrian presence several evenings per week this intersection is regularly blocked by eastbound cars filling the entire box they continue even after the light turns red and shorten the miniscule pedestrian crossing time further cars turning left from i street nw onto 17th street are coming very close to hitting pedestrians crossing 17th street a left turn arrow would solve this problem and the related problem of cars blocking the box after the light changes is this a highway or a residential street jeez need some traffic calming here there is a marked pedestrian crosswalk leading to the front of the takoma metro station that cars constantly ignore its signed but cars blast through at high speeds and its a very dangerous place they desperately need police to ticket there drivers use chestnut street as a through way from silver spring and the park the speed along the street and rarely stop at the stop signs the neighborhood needs sidewalks at the very least to keep pedestrians safe and off the road the asphalt around this intersection is dangerous to all on the road particularly bikers some of it is temporary construction some of it is poorly done patchwork but it would be worthwhile from a safety perspective to repave this area cars fail to stop as required by signs when pedestrians are in walkway cars will run this red light because they are focused on catching the green light at the following intersection the stop light here has a yield light not a green and there is no pedestrian light i have been crossing when the light unexpectedly changed and honked and yelled at by cars because i was in the intersection the road here is pockmarked with holes bumps rivets and all other manner of dangerous obstacles this affects everyone on the road but particularly cyclists please repave soon cars trying to turn right on red onto 395 from ny ave often fail to look for pedestrians crossing ny ave who have the right of way and signal to walk ive had numerous closecalls of almost getting hit in this way id suggest removing the slip lane on westbound florida which allows cars to turn right onto connecticut this slip lane is not safe for pedestrians as cars can maintain high speeds while going through this intersection i suggest removing the slip lane on this southbound section of connecticut avenue not only does this slip lane increase the distance a pedestrian needs to walk but also it allows a car to maintain high speeds going into this intersection 13th st has many potholes and a speed bump at bottom the hill this giant unmarked speed bump in the road is the result from a sloppy asphalting job by ddot i am aware of at least one cyclist flipping over his handle bars at this bump people often dangerously run this stop sign even though it is a very busy intersection school pedestrians crossing counterflowwestboundnorthbound bike lanes major northbound car thoroughfare hidden from vision large bumps at entry to intersection very dangerous on a very steep hill bumps likened to a speed hump road needs resurfacing or signs need to be posted for bikers at top of the hill need stop sign here only intersection in stretch of 11th that does not have a stop sign it causes many accidents this intersection seems to really cause problems for ddot now they painted a white line across the intersection and drivers n bound on 4th dont think they can turn left which is troublesome because there are 2 left turn lanes on 4th drivers continually block the bike boxes despite the green paint poorly marked crosswalk and speeding drivers this is a bad thing drivers routinely park in the outer westbound lane in front of the phyllis wheatley ywca during rush hour before 930 am idling and blocking the lane for other traffic drivers routinely cut across the bike lane when making turn from vermont southbound into 14th southboundthomas cir flexposts could help drivers routinely cut across the bike lane when going around thomas cir flexposts could help the pavement on this block of park road has been torn up for at least 69 months the height of the lanes is uneven i fell from my bike and was injured this is a common bike street there is no excuse for leaving this road in disrepair so long there are two lanes that turn onto new hampshire ave here but sometimes people in the right lane decide to continue going straight which is a hazzard putting up a barrier would prevent people from doing this preventing accidents cars routinely run this red light arrow often threatening pedestrians crossing with the light then they speed going down into the park around a blind curve drivers coming out of the park routinely get in shouting matches with bicyclists coming out of the park the bike lane back when there used to be one abruptly ends spilling bicyclists into car traffic rushing to get through the light cars come flying up and down this stretch of road almost never giving three feet to pass bicyclists so many double parkers along 14th street and cars fly down 14th so always a hazard when trying to go around double parkers protected bike lanes would be great cars parking in the circle not good poorly marked crosswalk we need do not enter signs g st is one way but double yellow lines for the counterflow bike lines confuse drivers every morning during rush hour there are delivery trucks blocking a lane on 20th street this makes for a dangerous driving and lane changing and lots of backed up cars its hard to get through on a bike not enough time for pedestrians to cross particularly across constitution cars should not be able to turn while pedestrians are crossing bike lanes need to be restriped here as cars and buses wear out the bike lanes as they unsafely cross into the bike lanes there is a very dangerous pothole here that needs to be filled it is in the southbound bike lane this intersection is dangerous for cyclists i have seen one accident and numerous close calls when cars are turning right onto k there is not a path for cyclists to safely pass them on the left see diagram of here httpgooglbwzna2 drivers routinely come out of the alley at high speeds and fail to stop as they enter the street this occurs all over the place but there are many children in this area with a daycare nearby can speed bumps or stop signs be added into alleys spirit of the odyssey shuttle bus double parked in bike lane a frequent occurrence the bike path along ohio drive should be wider and protected from adjacent traffic bike path along ohio drive should be protectedseparated from adjacent traffic gap in bike trails between capital crescent and georgetown waterfront parkrock creek forces bikers into traffic would only take one block of new trail lots of families and kids use this segment so would be high impact in terms of safety would be great to put a ramp for bikes on the two small steps so you have a connection from georgetown down to the waterfrontcapital crescentrock creek protected cycletrack on wisconsin please speeding is terrible here supposed to be 15mph during school and people routinely drive 3040 mph with small children walking take out the suicide turn lane inefficient use of space encourages illegal passing and install a cycletrack cars would still have two lanes narrow travel space would reduce speeds 25mph street bike path under the memorial bridge on ohio drive is very narrow it would ideally be widened or at least have a barrier to protect against adjacent traffic bike path under 66 here is very narrow and right next to fast moving traffic please install a wallbarrier to protect from cars please install a protected cycletrack on wisconsin cycletrack drivers running red light dangerous merge on ramp drivers never stop for pedestrians at this crosswalk there should be a stop sign cars are left on street with engine running and music blasting parking lot seems to be used for car repair service and houses immobile ice cream trucks allegedly used for buyingselling drugs cars do not stop of stop sign endangering pedestrians traffic study requested but no action taken because cars were not speeding enough issue of cars not stopping seemingly ignored cars do not stop of stop sign endangering pedestrians traffic study requested but no action taken because cars were not speeding enough issue of cars not stopping seemingly ignored ignore same comment at alley farther north on the street the pedestrian signal time crossing d street on louisiana ave changes from 56 minutes to 12 minutes instead of counting down fully drivers traveling east on d often run the red light after pedestrians on louisiana ave can start crossing d construction sign blocked entire sidewalk next to bus stop south west bound on monroe pedestrians and cyclists forced off the sidewalk aggressive panhandlers on sb north capitol street waiting to turn onto new york avenue they frequently block traffic lanes and act erratically impeding traffic and putting themselves into danger of being hit by a driver barrier against traffic is too low and too small for speeding cars here would be great to have a bike lane on p to connect rock creek and dupont gap in the bike trail here makes it dangerous especially for families and small kids please build a complete bike path connection between capital crescent and rock creek park trails ive seen taxi cabs constantly fail to yield at this intersection even cutting off two elderly women in the crosswalk with the pedestrian light on cars are constantly parking in the bike lanes here forcing bicyclists to mix with car traffic in a tight bottleneck today there were 4 cars parked in the northbound bike lane on 4th st fix this problem there are regularly cars waiting outside the holocaust museum which limits the road to one lane and causes cyclists to swerve into the lefthand lane white cadillac w plate numbers 02222m3 speed passed 2 bikers in a narrow area while on cell phone construction has left bike lane covered with debris from dumpster gravel and holes from current project makes debris and other street material kick up into pedestrian car and bike traffic the bicyclists always run the red light at this intersection often when cars are turning there needs to be enforcement of the rules concerning bicyclists here because if not someone is going to get severely hurt pedestrians consistently jaywalk here blocking traffic leaving union station black mercedes with dc plates fb 8422 made a right turn with no slowing down and almost hit a bike in the bike lane going straight and pedestrians in the crosswalk i doubt the driver had any idea we were there this stretch of c street is used as a virtual highway from around 5 in the morning until roughly 630 i live here and cars and trucks are easily going 40 mph through the light at c and 13th weekdays it wakes us up it is so loud cars speed down this stretch of c street all the time need a camera here bikers make right hand turns on red without stopping or looking to see if traffic is coming with the right of way the no turn in red from 12th southbound to monroe westbound should not be applicable to bikers because the bike lane starts there so there shouldnt be regular conflicts crosswalk needs to be repainted double wide sidewalk needs a sign to mark it as a bikefriendly sidewalk speed bump needs to ber repaired or removed now has a 4 inch ledge motorists drive too fast here motorists often go the wrong way on this oneway street very dangerous when waiting at the red light on a bike more common after dark drivers race here from the red light at n st to try to make the green light at p st it happens all the time and it is terrifying pedestrian crossing button on the westbound side of columbus circle ne side where cars go towards dept of labor doesnt work very reliably pressing the button gives no audio feedback nor does the indicator light show a red light cars are already using the bike lane to park in to go to the park pedestrians and bikers ignore the dont want signal constantly blocking traffic that has the rightofway unable to see oncoming traffic when leaving driveway many near accidents both as a driver pedestrian with other drivers speeding down the hill drivers really speed down this hill pedestrians cant safely cross to the sidewalk located only on the opposite side of the street drivers speed down the hill of arizona dangerous for both pedestrians trying to cross the street drivers trying to leave their driveways no one is ever manning the speed trap up the street from this location drivers really speed down this hill there is no crosswalk to allow for safe passage to the sidewalk across the street either install a crosswalk on both sides add a speed bump or both drivers go over speed limit and never stop for pedestrians in crosswalks drivers never stop for pedestrians drivers try to make a left turn from eb constitution onto nb 9th st nw despite no turn signal and street markings indicate no left turn as a pedestrian crossing the right turn lane of this exit from 395 is incredibly dangerous cars come through here too quickly but they are also unable to see pedestrians walking north due to the hedges until they are already in the crosswalk cars turning left from the highway never yield to pedestrians here i am almost hit at least once a week capital police officers witness this but do not seem to care there must not be enough time between this light turning red and the pedestrian sign turning to walk cars routinely speed through here 34 seconds after the walk signal has turned to allow pedestrians to cross its very dangerous this intersection is missing a crosswalk motorists turning right onto 21st st from m st can not see cyclists in the bike lane because of the parked cars blocking their view motorists speed through here very quickly and often ignore lane markings extremely dangerous bike lane constantly and perpetually blocked by motor vehicles no good bicycle connection between the mall and the mbt louisiana is pretty harrowing on a bike but the only way to get from the mall to the 1st street cycletrack and mbt no visibility around statue base when cycling west from va risky if a cyclist or pedestrian headed east is not keeping to the right stop signs for cyclists and pedestrians mean they never get row drivers treat lincoln circle like the freeway it is designed to be lots of speeding cut through traffic between connecticut and reno cars heading se on massachusetts and turning right on wisconsin ave nw heading south do not slow down enough for pedestrians crossing wisconsin ave cars heading nw on massachusetts and turning right on wisconsin ave nw heading north do not slow down enough for pedestrians crossing wisconsin ave cars turning often fail to stop for pedestrians crossing the street midblock crosswalk needed here long distance to crosswalks heavy pedestrian traffic btw north side federal triangle metro wilson plazareagan bldg events downtown dc and south side of street american history museum national mall cabs queue up regularly and block the crosswalk there are no traffic controls for cars on ogden and the intersection is designed with a vast area of pavement for cars to maneuver but no refuge for pedestrians this is worsened due to onstreet parking as it worsens visibility for pedestrians there are no ada compliant ramps when crossing center street at the intersection with ogden street nor for crossing the eastern leg of ogden street at this same intersection this is a frustrating intersection to cross to cross 16th street one endures a long cycle length a short pedestrian phase and no alternative crossing a crosswalk at spring place and a longer pedestrian phase at spring road are recommended cars driving east on legation can not see cars traveling north on reno41st due to cards parked too close to the corner very hard to cross turn left or right shrubs on public land on the west side of reno at chevy chase pkwy are blocking the view of the intersection there is a tree and sign showing where parking is permitted as you exit morrison street nw onto 41st nw is very dangerous as cars park legally behind the sign and the tree together with the car block vision for oncoming cars headed for western av shrubs block view of reno from jenifer street making crossing reno or turning onto reno very dangerous peds dont wait for the walk signal and cross penn ave although cars and bikes have green light to proceed peds congregate in center island and block bike lane esp when we have a green light cars block center island and the bike lane some try to drive on the bike lane or make uturns 39 th reno is a dangerous intersection where visability is lacking i have seen several nearmisses i have lived on 39th st for 12 years and witnessed too many accidents to count on 39th and reno due to poor visibility there have been studies for this intersection by ddot but no real action cut the shrubs before a life is takenits ridiculous car accident on k street heading east and turning left on west virginia speeding was involved cars turning left from 6th onto florida routinely do not yield to pedestrians crossing florida ave the intersection needs to be redesigned allow turning left on green arrow only so pedestrians can cross without cars showing up at their heels sidewalks on south side of east capitol street between 18th and 19th are too narrow drivers ignore short light for pedestrians makes terrible intersection even worse for pedestrians bike route through intersection from noma to eckington is ludicrously complicated and unsafe pedestrians frequently either jwalk or begin crossing intersection when the sign reads dont walk this leaves drivers who are trying to turn in any direction under 5 seconds to make all turns no wonder about backups and red light running the light to cross nj is extremely short the wait to cross f street is extremely short the street signs say that you should bie across traffic and take a ludicrous route through the intersection to get to the bike lane on eckington place the sidewalks under the bridge are too narrow pedestrians block the bike lane in the middle of mass ave it is not painted or separated here the sidewalks under the tracks here are far too narrow drivers are extremely confused by this intersection because it is not clear how they are supposed to get onto n capitol street also there is a stop sign in one direction and a streetlight in the other but there is no pedestrian light cars speed off of north capitol street in this direction should be eliminated in favor of a 90 degree right turn a lot of jaywalking near the intersection and crosswalk just a few feet away there are too many close calls with pedestrians walking out from between parked cars parked outside of parking times there is a crosswalk across new hampshire ave nw on corcoran st nw it isnt signaled but there are big signs indicating to drivers to yield to pedestrians in the crosswalk few drivers actually do so drivers routinely ignore the no turn on red sign at this intersection drivers often fail to yield to pedestrians in the crosswalks before and after the bridge over the canal this is an unsignaled crosswalk across 18th st nw at corcoran st nw drivers routinely do not yield to pedestrians in this crosswalk despite large signs instructing them to do so drivers in the inner and outer lanes of dupont circle are confused about which red light signal corresponds to their respective lane cars turning onto wisconsin ave from mass ave come up from behind my son was strucked by an automobile in a hit and run the motorist was trying to hurry through the light when was struck the speed down this street in the morning is ridiculous please make a change eugenia ford 2023002647 along this stretch the motorist coming in from maryland are running light and speeding at high speed there are no sidewalks for several blocks on blair rd ne this is a highly pedestrian trafficked route due to public transit and several schools nearby there is a missing stop sign at this intersection on hamilton this is a busy road with lots of pedestrian and school children as well as heavy trucks and accidents are frequent cars frequently runs red lights due to poor intersection design and signage this is a high risk intersection for pedestrians especially children attending the nearby schools 3 of them traffic accidents are comment do a traffic calming survey cars frequently block the crosswalk due to poor intersection design and signage this is a high risk intersection for pedestrians especially children attending the nearby schools 3 of them traffic accidents are comment cars frequently fail to stop for pedestrian due to poor intersection design and signage this is a high risk intersection for pedestrians especially children attending the nearby schools 3 of them traffic accidents are comment drivers turn right on red without checking for bikers on cycletrack right turn on red should be banned by cycletrack cars run red on left hand turn signal almost hit cyclists who have green light cars turning right on red onto k fail to shield to bikers right on red should be banned here many cars use the bus stop bay as an unofficial turning lane onto 6th street ne this issue can cause sideswiping and confused motorists who may endanger bikers moving north on 6th street when cars run the red light on maryland they sometimes block the entire intersection making it very dangerous for a pedestrian to cross during rush hour cars and especially buses block the entire intersection large tour buses take up the box and block the pedestrian crosswalk making it extremely dangerous to cross its tough to see pedestrians crossing at this point cars are parking in the poorly demarcated bike lane cars are using the bike lane for lefthand turns due to the poorly marked lanes often difficult to safely cross this intersection due to cars blocking the box and southbound cars turning right across cycle track albermarle st nw desperately needs to be repaved from 39th st nw to connecticut ave nw eastbound the road surface is in extremely poor condition and is hazardous for cyclists riding downhill 3x week i am almost hit by cars in the crosswalk w the pedestrian light on green cars coming from north and south turning onto independence drive too fast into the turn not yielding access to pedestrians all looked at me like i was jaywalking this intersection is especially bad with regards to cars turning left when they have a red arrow do not turn signal ddot should look to see if they can improve the signals at this intersection to make it clear that cars can not turn on the red arr the light changes so quickly that even people without disabilities have difficulty crossing in time stop dragging your feet ddot and extend the cycle track there needs to be bike lanes on kansas nw between 13th and georgia even if it means removing parking spaces the homes along this area have alley parking serious gap in cycling infrastructure that is very unsafe ive been nearly hit by aggressive please continue the bike lanes through the traffic circle please convert conventional bike lanes on kansas to protected bike lanes this will protect cyclists from getting doored which is a real possibility with all of the parked cars along this road cross 18th st nw is a very long wait for pedestrians many pedestrians jaywalk at this intersection because the wait is ridiculous double parking including parking in the bike lane is a big problem in front of the hotel on new hampshire ave nw also many cars do uturns in the middle of the block which is hazardous to all road users on these blocks between r s streets nw bike lane often blocked by drivers using it as a rightturn lane drivers fail to notice bikers in the bike lane and almost hit them when they attempt to turn right without looking t street has no stop sign cant see cars from 16 street with cars on both sides of the street i was in an accident at that intersection because i couldnt see the suv coming please extend the bike lane along 3rd st between kansas and blair this is a major route for cyclists and deserves improvement to increase safety cars going north on 1st routinely run the red left turn arrow when turning onto k st problem cars going south on 16th st turning right onto military zooming through a crosswalk with a walk light i bike along the sidewalk and have had multiple times where if i had blindly followed the walk light i would have been hit people assume this is a 4 way stop when its not needs better labeling bc people have close calls when the car in front breaks quickly when theres an assumed stop sign but theres really not inconsistent w other intersections close by theres no right turn on red here and when the pedestrian signal says stopthe light is still red so pedestrians think they can chance it same if youre turning left walk and car signals are both at a halt so pedestrians just walk on out commuters speed up and down 5th street nw including swerving around stopped 6263 buses and into the oncoming traffic lane these buses carry large numbers of kids going to school and the kids are oftentimes preparing to cross the street cars traveling eastwest on missouri often speed through the red lights alsocars turning south on 5th from the westbound lanes often swing into the northbound lanes of 5th near the crosswalk nearly hitting cyclists waiting for the light to change trucks offloading to trader joes daily block the bike lanes and force bikes into the main travel lanes during rush hour md and va commuter buses pile up here and block traffic and crosswalks they also emit noticeably bad exhaust not sure if that can be regulated by dc but galling to have outofstaters pollute our air and flaunt traffic laws while paying no taxes delivery trucks to restaurants and upsfedex trucks block travel lanes at all times of day particularly in the morning and afternoon it severely blocks travel on eye st and prompts speeding from frustrated drivers bad for bikers terrible intersection in the am southbound cars whip around buses and cut each other out from the eastern lanes speeding into the crosswalk where many people are crossing having penn ave nw closed between 15th 17th destroys the planned eastwest traffic flow in the city creating safety problems on h and i open it back up to traffic and revert h and i to how they used to be ubertaxivaletdrop offs in front of masa 14 that take over the bike lane and the right traffic lane dc needs to remove crosswalks without stop signs or traffic signals on 4 lane roads especially in this block because there is poor visibility to see people using the crosswalks on very busy streets cars routinely park in the cycletrack including construction vehicles for the washington post building i have yet to see the busbike lane enforced the sharrows designation should be removed because 7th is too dangerous for cyclists if its not enforced please add a bike lane to 7th cars often drive aggressively towards cyclists heading towards the penn ave cycle track please fix the potholes on this block so drivers will stop veering into the bike lane to avoid the the holes pedestrians dont have a designated place to wait at intersections on penn ave so cyclists using the cycletrack are often forced too close to the traffic lane to avoid people waiting to cross the intersection cyclists run this stop sign daily without recourse even with police cars posted at this intersection regardless of whether or not pedestrians are in the crosswalk please step up traffic enforcement of cyclists the lane lines are too faded on 15th so cars often drive in 2 lanes or in and out of lanes this area is extremely poorly lit i have had at least 3 close calls with cars that couldnt see me at the cross walk its a matter of time until some fatality occurs this is a pedestrian crossing at a fourlane road there is very poor lighting in the area and no special pedestrian lights or bright signs cars speed frequently and go around cars that have stopped for pedestrians it is very dangerous cars and commercial vehicles speed up columbia road between 11th and 13th in order to make the light at 13th and columbia there are many accidents and near misses at this intersection there is no stop sign going ew on v st here so cars fly through the intersection the visibility is poor for cars bikes and pedestrians so it is very difficult to safely cross especially for pedestrians an allway stop is badly needed there is no stop sign on v st and the cars speed both ways to avoid traffic on ri ave there is also poor visibility due to the hill on v st to the west and parked cars ive almost been hit multiple times and have witnessed more than one accident cars regularly take extremely fast and unsafe right turns from florida ave nw onto 4th street nw as theyre heading north the corner should be extendedreconfigured to slow down right turns speed humps should be added to 4th street nw as well cars coming up ontario from the direction of harvard street often fail to stop due to poor visibility of the crosswalk and pedestrians due to the curve in the street cars also do not obey the yield to pedestrians sign that is posted south side sidewalk is too narrow between mt pleasant and 16th st consider moving the fence toward the building at least give pedestrians some elbow room the sidewalk next to this tree planter is less than 3 wide and the concrete is lifted and impassable for a wheelchair i am a disabled pedestrian walking with a cane while crossing at 21stmst crosswalk this morning an enterprise van failed to stop practically hitting me i slammed its side so driver could hear i was there how can this crosswalk be more enforced a street traffic does not realize 8th st cross traffic does not have a stop sign there is an accident here weekly kids are all over this block it is a very dangerous intersection add a sign on a st indicating cross traffic does not stop cars on a st do not realize traffic on 8th does not stop accidents here regularly kids are all over this block install signs on a st stating that cross traffic does not stop help a st traffic does not realize 8th st does not have a stop sign accidents here regularly very dangerous intersection kids are all over this block install signs on a st noting cross traffic does not stop the lane alignment changes significantly on florida avenue between 8th and 9th streets making it very easy to run headon into oncoming traffic this is a very scary section of road crossing new hampshire from both directions on s street is extremely difficult due to low visibility having a multilane stop sign is just ridiculous at various intersections traveling south on 17th street these exist and it is so dangerous there are no signs for drivers entering dupont circle drivers in the right lane often merge into the inner circle and drivers in the left lane merge into the outer circle which could cause an accident the bike lane traveling west on m st separates from the traffic lane at this location however the bike lane makes a very sharp turn that is difficult to navigate without veering into the traffic lane which is very hazardous during rush hour dangerous light pattern in circle pedestrians crossing from hospital side see red lights lanes of stopped traffic think they can cross cant see cars in far lanes still traveling around circle at high speed someone may get killed cars speed through this block of ga ave regularly our office is here and weve witnessed 3 accidents out front in the last 2 months just during working hours pulling onto georgia from hamilton is also dangerous in both directions this is a high volume truck intersection and the signal timing does not allow enough trucks to get through which backs up the intersection drivers run the red light here as pedestrians are trying to cross every day people blow through these lights in particular east bound perhaps better timing and a red light camera would help every morning there are cars driving west on mass ave that start to move across 15th street even though they are not able to fully clear the intersection bikes and pedestrians have to weave through cars once the walk signal turns on crosswalks badly need to be repainted despite stop for pedestrian signs nobody stops and cars block the cross walks all the time cars heading east on ri ave frequently run the red light there is a red light camera that catches cars heading west but not east who gave the permit for this fucking dumpster why is some private company allowed to turn this road into a one way right next to traffic light for over a year unacceptable to have this thing sitting here for over a year cars never stop here and are going very fast ive almost been hit multiple times this intersection needs a stop sign these crosswalks are always blocked by traffic and are poorly marked lines are faded because of red light camera intersection is only lit by one street light at night inter section needs to have better lighting cars speed up the hill and do not yield for pedestrians cars frequently blow through this stop sign without stopping fail to understand rightsofway at the 8way stop at this confusing intersection and fail to stop for pedestrians in the crosswalk cars frequently blow through this intersection without stopping and fail to stop for pedestrians in the crosswalk they also fail to understand rightsofway at the approaching 8way stop at this confusing and very dangerous intersection between 2nd nw and n cap there are large patches of gravel in the bike lane very dangerous the surface area is in terrible condition as well but the immediate need is cleaning up the gravel there are no sidewalks on this road and when politics prose hosts a big name author this road is full of parked cars and pedestrians despite the safety hazards drivers speed here to bypass connecticut ave and nebraska ave traffic no sidewalks here this road is treated like an interstate it is unpatrolled by law enforcement so speeders love this road no sidewalk for much of northampton which is a connector street for many pedestrians to the park off of oregon ave intersection is confusing most drivers do not know which road military or broad branch the no left turn sign applies to this road is very dark and can be dangerous for pedestrians a hidden stop sign around here is routinely run long blind turn for those turning right onto military from nebraska often there are cars parked on nebraska in the lane that cars turn into most people do not stop for pedestrians in the crosswalk on carroll st nw to get to the takoma metro much of the sidewalks in this area are in poor repair or do not exist some are not wide enough to push a stroller on there are school children from st johns high school that have to unnecessarily cross the dangerous street in this area there is no reason that this should be a 1 way street for noncommercial vehicles it just adds to increased congestion on other roads and therefore increased safety issues for pedestrians and cyclists on those roads drivers frequently create 2 lanes here when going east bound entrance onto the road is very difficult given the design of the onramp no merge area no sidewalk for much of this area in the mornings and afternoons young children catch the d series and w series and m series bus to school here the intersection and lights are confusing drivers turning east onto military do not watch for pedestrians at the broad branch or military intersections the intersection and lights are confusing drivers turning east onto military do not obey the red light in front of the broad branch road drivers turn right on red here frequently failing to stop for pedestrians crossing nebraska sometimes cars pass through a red light while pedestrians are crossing washington ave sw towards the american veterans disabled for life memorial or towards the rayburnbartholdi park my office overlooks this crosswalks many near misses of pedestrians someone will get badly hurt cars must be slowed or stopped multiple slammed breaks every hour need to explain the new signal better to drivers some blow right through it when they arent supposed to and others stop at the light when they dont need to can create dangerous situations for all involved due to the large turning radius on the southeast corner of the intersection the speed of right turning vehicles heading northbound and turning eastbound to arkansas avenue is very high and not safe for pedestrians some carsbuses stop for pedestrians to cross but other cars go around stopped cars there is no yellow pedestrian crossing sign however those signs dont seem to work and stopping for pedestrian crossing isnt enforced in dc jfg as a pedestrian i witnessed a car running a stop sign nearly striking a cyclist jdfkle on several occasions i have nearly been hit by westbound cars on k street that blatantly run a red light a white truck sped from the inner lane to the illinois ave exit as the driver passed near me he said ill fing run you over next time this is an issue at this crosswalk as cars are also speeding and exiting the circle at high speeds most days the bike lane is clogged here often buses that get held up at the stoplight and protrude into the new york ave intersection often cars are waiting to pick someone up and block the righthand lane almost every day i am a biker car driver and pedestrian not just one of the three drivers heading down macomb streets hill travel 3040 mph the school zone speed limit of 15mph makes speed tables or other traffic calming important cars turning left from calvert downhill onto shoreham dr often fail to stop for pedestrians crossing shoreham dr probably a combination of it being a difficult left turn at rush hour and being unable to see pedestrians until partway through turn driver of wmata bus 7207 did not signal pull out and then did not signal as he cut across two lanes of traffic in traffic circle forcing other vehicles already in lane to take evasive action bus failure to signal in this area is common there needs to be a marked accessible crosswalk across this large intersection currently there is no safe way to cross to the trail on the other side of the street we should be able to access the sidewalk and trail from the neighborhood delivery vehicles consistently block lanes during rush hour very dangerous and no one seems to want to fix the issue there is a lack of an ada compliant cutout on the east side of 10th street when you are trying to cross from the small island at michigan to the main sidewalk poor lane markings on aspen st nw under the metro overpass drivers travelling westbound will use the wrong side of the road eastbound to turn left onto blair causes nearmisses and traffic jams as drivers are blocked in the intersection southbound on sandy spring stop sign here is new and drivers run it very often the sign is partially blocked by tree limb and possibly an electric pole this problem is in conjunction with the speeding that occurs through here drivers speed through here probably trying to avoid traffic on blair traffic calming is needed here this would help the other issues at the intersection with aspen and at laurel narrow road tight turn limited visibility many wrecks and nearmisses re bike lane on 6th st ne that connects across florida ave ne there is no pavement marker in the intersection to indicate that is a bike lane cars turning right or left onto florida dont realize bikes cross there and its a hazard dump trucks and other heavy rigs are increasingly using south dakota ave ne a residential street they speed and pollute and shake the sidewalks as they go by the sidewalks on florida ave are not big enough to accommodate a wheelchair or stroller they are right next to heavy traffic with no buffer cars are constantly speeding down this street which makes it unsafe for neighbors and especially children speed bump would be helpful in addition to more police monitoring drivers uberlyft drivers often stopdouble park here reducing traffic to 1 lane and making it dangerous when cars swerve into the left lane to avoid the double parkers terrible views here with the blind hill terrible views here with bling hill in the rock creek east ii study gallatin and hamilton were identified as future eastwest connectors for bike shared roads can bicycle shared road symbols be expedited as this area gets heavy eastwest bicycle traffic the sidewalk on the cemetery side of the road dissapears this is a very hectic intersection and a sidewalk would make this much safer at intersections on 3rd street there are crosswalks with two parallel lines and cars and bicyclists dont yield to pedestrians a higher visibility crosswalk with a ladder pattern would increase visibility and safety car traffic does not stop for pedestrians at this intersection i watched a man on crutches make his way across from brookland yesterday and was worried for his life pair this with the speeding on ri ave and it made for a harrowing crossing this intersection is dangerous because cars on franklin often stop in the middle of the intersection as they queue up for the signal to the east and traffic coming westbound on franklin are difficult to see if youre on 15th trying to cross nbound car drivers speed constantly on michigan ave going from 395 off ramp on s capitol no on follows street lines that lead to far left lanes drivers in left lane of off ramp drive straight and almost hit cars in right lane following lanes reckless driver was honking at bikers along 18th street from florida ave to new hampshire ave at 18th and s st intersection light turned green the aggressive driver sped up went around a car in front of it and cut it off in middle of intersection drivers turning right from virginia onto 23rd do not stop for pedestrians also there is only 1 turn lane but drivers always create a second and the second turn lane has terrible visibility of pedestrians in the crosswalk drivers often fail to yield to pedestrians at crosswalk west across northbound 9th st arrangement of intersection requires pedestrians to use two crosswalks to cross to the north side of g st when walking north up the east side of 9th st pedestrians often jaywalk to avoid the extra distance timing of lights managing merge of southbound 12th st and eastbound maine avenue is highly problematic sensors should be used so cars dont wait for nonexistent traffic also causes issues with pedestrian signal timing intersection of 9th st south freeway off ramp g st and slip lane to lenfant promende is confusing and numerous close calls occur everyday signage is significantly lacking given the far from standard configuration significant volume of cars making left turns from 9th st southbound to westbound maine avenue failing to pay attention to or yield to pedestrians in cross walk crosswalk lines are completely missing reported to 311 but no response there are no stop signs at this intersection and cars fly up and down 14th street someone is going to be killed car drivers and bicyclists have a tough time navigating both the yearlong lane closure and rerouting on sb 1st street only to contend with double parking by cabuberlyft and dropoffs for hotels this is very hazardous for bicyclists after 300 pm taxis line to pickup customers at union station not allowing buses to make right turn which adds in blocking traffic and pedestrian crossing at the intersection cars drive through this intersection very fast on 13th st and dont stop for pedestrians despite the cross walk the current signage on the road is knocked down at least once a week and is not effective every morning at rush hour lots of cars in all directions running stop signs sometimes soft roll through sometimes egregiously cars turning left from m northbound onto 33rd have a green left turn arrow but fail to stop for pedestrians that have a walk signal across 33rd once the left turn arrow disappears pedestrians must press a beg button to activate walk signal and walk signal timer is extremely short traffic signal for northbound traffic constantly stays green even when pedestrians have a walk signal and would be safer crossing harewood road if traffic was stopped see issue 44961 car driving north on hawaii passed another moving car also driving north on hawaii by crossing doubleyellow line pedestrians crossing harewood road from south to north must look over their shoulder to see oncoming traffic making a right from rock creek church road to harewood road cars speed through the intersection and fail to allow pedestrians to cross drivers traveling northsouth on 6th st tend to run this stop sign or only pause briefly here many of these drivers are coming from missouri avenue and appear to trying to shortcut around stoplights and bus routes there is an apartment bldg on the east side of the rd and rideshare and delivery drivers tend to stop there though there is no parking or standing area there is no safe way for other vehicles to pass and poor visibility though this street is narrow drivers tend to speed down the center of the road and not accommodate drivers coming in the opposite direction it leads to a lot of nearmiss headon collisions and road rage incidents when westbound mo ave has the green the right lane gets blocked by vehicles turning north on ga drivers will swerve and switch lanes midintersection to avoid the blockage eastbound drivers routinely run the red light at this intersection and block the box the left turn lane from eastbound missouri onto northbound georgia is very short and almost always backs up blocking the through lane and the previous intersection consider eliminating the turn lane during evening rush hour drivers on colorado avenue can not turn right onto missouri avenue while properly observing yield laws if they then attempt to turn left onto georgia they can only do so by blocking three lanes of traffic some cyclists choose military rd as an eastwest route across rock creek park as there arent many alternatives nearby they are hard to see and avoid bc traffic speeds so greatly and curves in road no bike trail exists adjacent to the road it is very difficult for drivers traveling eastwest to see and yield to northsouth traffic because of parked cars in the curb lane a lot of drivers also get confused and think this is a fourway stop drivers westbound on military rd in the left turnonly often decide that they want to continue traveling straight on military rd they will change lanes in the intersection without yielding this can happen one or more times per light cycle despite the concrete median on missouri avenue drivers on southbound rock creek church rd will turn left onto missouri they often endanger pedestrians in the crosswalk as they do so if i drive 40 in this 35 mph zone other drivers will tailgate me so closely that i can hardly see the hoods of their cars with merging traffic in the right lane and the curves in the road i am very uncomfortable with the average rate of speed pedestrians crossing western must cross three sections of road at between concrete barriers each section has its own walk light which is not synchronized with the others it takes more than one light cycle for peds to legally cross the road drivers westbound on military who are turning left onto western will change lanes midturn this is due to confusion about which lanes go where at the western and wisconsin intersection the lane changes cause near collisions and block crosswalks ddot finally reinstalled crosswalk here but cars now park on either side of the crosswalk blocking visibility ive been asking for some do not park signs to be installed here for the last 6 months private cars taxis and buses all speed down this stretch drivers enterexit driveway without looking for pedestrians first very dangerous considering that there are 3 schools in the immediate vicinity the crosswalk is fadedmissing here pedestrian visibility is very poor here especially given the nearby 3 schools and heavy vehicular traffic a crossing guard would be an added plus cars often block the crosswalk across riggs making it difficult for pedestrians to safely cross the street there are many bustops on this street as well as 3 schools in the vicinity it is very difficult to cross the street at the marked crosswalks cars speed up and down south dakota which compounds the issue this is a school zone yet cars speed by during the school day cars coming off of 395 do not yield to pedestrians many drivers if they do stop continue to inch their cars toward pedestrians still in the crosswalk this has been an issue for at least 8 years now cars turning onto galloway from sd ave do not yield to pedestrians in the crosswalk there is nothing in between pedestrians and cars except for a 23 inch thick cinderblock that is about 3 feet tall there is also only enough room for 1 pedestrian to walk finally there is zero lighting if you want to cross legally you have to wait more than a minute to cross 1st st even though there are no cars there is a long left hand turn light and no one ever turns left 24 seconds to cross 4 lanes of traffic watch a school group try its darwinian right turn on red and green its like they are aiming for pedestrians buses illegally blocking bike lane and letting off passengers every single day so no stop sign cars just run red lights here every single day i see 5 cars each cycle during the morning and usually another 12 each cycle in the evening not just 1 second late but like 34 seconds late surprised more people not hit here watched from my car as a group of kids tried to cross the street in time they didnt make it thankfully cars stopped for them kids were small too shame on dc traffic planners clearly hate children crossing street 15 mph speed limit here is a joke surprised more people not hit especially at rush hour side walk blocked by construction meanwhile cars speed this is a speed way for cars and city just repaved id love to see how many cars get over 60 mph on this stretch this is one of the most unsafe intersections in this part of the city 4th street needs dramatic traffic calming drivers routinely cross the double yellow on this stretch and pass illegally at very high speed one of our neighbors has dozens of instances of this type of behavior on security camera footage 4th street requires comprehensive traffic calming need crosswalk between new curb cuts missing crosswalk between new curb cuts dangerous speeding in c street school zone no turn on red sign is barely visible westbound cars turn very fast from c st to 19th st ne endangering pedestrians in this school zone westbound cars that turn left during green endanger eastbound pedestrians and cyclists dangerous morning speeding within the school zone need to permanently narrow the road and provide better enforcement throughout the day speeding in the school zone distance across c st ne is very long at seven lanes wide this is extremely unsafe for pedestrians and school children especially when considering the rampant speeding that occurs within five of these seven lanes light poles are blocking the sidewalks making them unusable for people in wheelchairs westbound vehicles on c st ne that turn left at 17th st ne routinely fail to yield to pedestrians and cyclists in the southern crosswalk left turns from 19th to benning should be banned at this intersection poor options for crossing benning road ne long distances and not fully ada accessible need to open a new crosswalk on the west side of the intersection where there currently is none cars going north on 19th st ne do not stop for pedestrians this is a school zone lots of jaywalking because the crossing distances are too far apart on c st ne too much speeding here during the transition of highway to residential streets sidewalks are not ada accessible there are light poles in the middle of the blocks that infringe on pedestrian space and make the sidewalks unusable for people in wheelchairs cars roll through the intersection without coming to a full stop they often do not yield to pedestrians and cyclists most are outofstate drivers vehicles that are turning left from 19th st ne to benning rd ne can not fully see on coming traffic this is a very dangerous intersection that needs to be redesigned there is no crosswalk on the west side of the intersection so people jaywalk left turns from 19th to benning often result in westbound cars being stuck in the intersection blocking eastbound traffic northsouth crossings on benning road are very long and unfriendly toward pedestrians eastbound leftturning vehicles conflict with westbound bicyclists and pedestrians we need to make eb left turns signalized cars coming southbound on georgia that are turning continue after their light is red which is when pedestrians can cross florida cars turning often fail to yield to pedestrians and bikes in all directions i have almost been hit here a number of times this crosswalk is absolutely terrifying and dangerous it is supposed to link two sides of fort circle trail and give pedestrians a direct path to the local library but cars go so fast rarely stop and theres never any enforcement please help überhöhte geschwindigkeit erhöhter zeitaufwand beim gleiswechsel wegen der anderen fußgänger biker fahren auch bei rot über die kreuzung abbiegende pkws die radfahrer haben das nachsehen viele von ihnen weichen auf den fußweg aus ecke kumpfmühler straßefritz fendtstraße keine führung des radverkehrs vom dachauplatz richtung galgenbergbrücke stress mit auto und busverkehr zu wenig platz gefahr durch rechtsabbieger starker verkehr kein platz für radfahrer sidewalk blocked with garbage cans weekly se of this location at the western side of rock creek on joyce rd nw a trail crosses the road without a sidewalk pedestrians have a hard time seeing cars due to the angle of the road crosswalk needed drivers headed south on 10th regularly turn left on red onto m a two way street westbound cyclists run this red light often without slowing down through a crowded crosswalk left turn from nb 7th onto frontage rd is a very short light map placed this marker at incorrect intersection not only do cars run the red to try to squeeze extra time but they frequently run the red arrow lack of left turn signal from sb 7th onto i means cars are competing to cross in front of nb traffic while pedestrians are crossing i the light was changed to give a left turn before pedestrians can cross pedestrians instead cross first because that is normal need normal turn pattern pedestrians first countdown to stop them then left turn across the crosswalk the light is poorly timed here for pedestrians walking north if you cross ma ave then make your way to p street you will hit p just as the hand starts flashing if you are walking very fast cars then are furious have had multiple close calls drivers regularly exceed speed limit on the 1600 block of 32nd st its a oneway downhill street and vehicles fly drivers regularly run stop signs at 32nd and reservoir theres no crosswalk at this intersection and its dangerous for peds gap in sidewalk on east side of 39th street kids walk to playground this way and are forced to walk in the street please add a stop sign on both ramps to allow trail users to cross the street cars often go through at high speed without looking going eb no room to go around cars to get to the light bc the cars are 2 close together dont leave room on either side i always have to go into the wb opp traffic lane to get around i have seen bikes bump into cars fall trying to get around can we please get a bike lane on florida ave both ways the road quality is terrible and the drivers are extremely aggressive this connection would work nicely with the proposed 20th21st22nd bike lane project i am so frickin tired of cars blocking the bike lanes in this city can we get some enforcement r street is notorious for this can we please get some enforcement of cars blocking the bike lane it is really unsafe not to mention very annoying and no one cares especially not the guy blocking the lane the entitled attitude of drivers in this town is getting really old cars and drivers are too aggressive in this city people come from out of town ruralsuburban areas and expect to go 50mph everywhere if you get in their way be prepared to get run over when are things going to change is anyone listening ddot does anyone notice a theme here how many comments here are from motorists ill tell you almost none do you know why its because motorists and cars get all the rights vulnerable road users have to fight to get simple protections fix this now cars will block the access to the trail here they also back into the road without yielding to bikes accessing the trail there is not enough room for 2 bikes to get thru the gate at once which already makes it difficult to get on the trail truck with trailer blocking the bike lane box truck blocking the bike lane cars parked in the bike lane tour bus parked in the bike lane car driving northbound in bike lane got stuck at the bollard reversed up bike lane no parking sign missing illegally parked cars too close to intersection and overgrown hedges obstruct drivers view on scott place turning onto 32nd st very dangerous for peds on sidewalkcars coming south on 32nd the intersection at 13th and c has a bus stop on the ne corner that is regularly used as a passing lane by drivers who speed around to move forward in the queue there are also issues with rtor and conflicts with pedestrians the bike lane northbound on 13th st ends abruptly forcing bikes to merge into traffic with a school near by it is very dangerous and likely reduces the number of families willing to commute by bike to school please extend the bike lane northward excessive speeding on c st ne putting pedestrians and cyclists at risk happens early in the morning and late at night when traffic is lighter and flow is not slow enough drivers heading south on 12th place look left at westbound traffic on constitution and have nearly hit multiple children in the crosswalk at 12th place they roll the stop sign and never look right drivers and children regularly conflict at this crosswalk where an 11year old was nearly killed in 2016 please address the area around the school prior to the return to the building due to construction in aug 2019 double threat crosswalk excessive speeds and red light running make the intersection at 17th and constitution ne very dangerous with 100 students at 3 schools nearby this needs to be addressed urgently there is no stop sign here despite location near multiple schools and the d6 bus stop drivers almost never stop please consider adding a 4way stop east bound d street bike lane abruptly ends here at 13th please extend all the way to the anacostia trail as this is a key bike artery to get to rfktrail long light cycle means drivers heading south run light a lot particularly bad in the morning and evening rush hour speeding at all hours of the day occur here as drivers try to make the light at mass please add a stop sign here drivers rush to make the light at lincoln park no connecting bike lane from c forces bikes into traffic risking their lives drivers speed at all hours on this wide avenue i have also seen at least 3 cars drive the wrong way northbound on this street new raised crosswalk is helpful but drivers do not stop speeding also continues to be an issue and 15 mph school zone limit is not obeyed heavily trafficked intersection with 500 plus students and their families trying to get to school near fatal accident here please remedy now there needs to be a stop sign on this corner drivers routinely speed through and nearly hit pedestrians this is a busy corner because it is en route to the elementary school there needs to be a protected left turn arrow for northbound on georgia turning west on kalmia when drivers can finally turn they are stuck in the small space between alaska and georgia until that light changes bus stop on one corner candy store onanother and three schools within 3 blocks make this a heavy ped area for children drivers do not stop for peds crossing 15th illegal left turns illegal u turns kids running into oncoming traffic to catch bus on south side of street even police cars almost been hit twice while pushing a stroller unsafe walking due to illegal uturns and illegal lefthand turns cars have to unexpectedly merge left to go straight if they are in the right most land heading eastbound on m illegal parking cars making illegal left turns and uturns and speeding up to dodge pedestrians 13th street between alaska avenue and kalmia should put a no left turn sign at 13th and alaska avenue and a camera also sign says donot enter between 4 630 pm but it is ignored by all install cameras many cars coming through this light eastbound on irving st are going far too fast and often driving in the bike lane it seems the road is far too wide and this encourages speeding no bicycle lanes are present on 16th at all even though a substantial number of cyclists use this street so there are numerous conflicts with cyclists and pedestrians sharing a very limited space need bike lanes cars are often parked in the cyclist contraflow lane here forcing southbound cyclists into direct conflict with northbound cars ruthless double and triple parking in the bike box often by mpdfederal police cruisers at the intersection of riggs road and eastern ave cars drive straight through from the rightturn only lane then try to merge it is very dangerous as a driver not to mention pedestrianbiker approaching this intersection from either side of u street next to no visibility due to houses close to intersection needs a fourway stop left turns from westbound c st ne to southbound tennessee ave ne are too fast and the crossing distance is too wide left turns from westbound c st ne to southbound tennessee ave ne are too fast drivers often fail to stop at macarthur blvdcrosswalk this is partly due to vehicles frequently illegally parked just before the entrance to the shopping plaza at edmunds and macarthur which blocks oncoming westbound drivers view of the crosswalk twice within the past year a car jumped the curb and demolished the chain link fence on the southeast corner of this intersection drivers do not anticipate the curve in the road all 5 homeowners on the nw corner of this intersection has had at least one of our vehicles significantly damaged when a driver traveling at an excessive rate of speed couldnt navigate the curve in the road and the reduction from two lanes to one route to school cars coming west on c street ne at high speeds often turn left onto 17th street and put lives at risk because they are going fast turn at anytime during the traffic signal should change to left on green arrow only cars not able to see pedestrians and high traffic area for children with 3 schools within 2 blocks of this intersection saferoutestoschool and no changes after years of request there should be a turn signal westbound on c onto 17th this is a speedway as cars aggressively try to race through lights and get out of neighborhood easily 4050 mph on a daily basis there should be a stop sign at this intersection as many many kids walk from school to metro and the cars on 19th speed down one way road with wide lanes and no signage to stop for pedestrians school zone should be priority for stop sign safety double threat crosswalk excessive speeds and no signage for pedestrians make the intersection at 17th and 19th ne extremely dangerous with 800 students at 3 schools within one block this needs to be addressed urgently every day i see dozens on violations at this light cars in left turn lane cut off through traffic to skip in line and often block the intersection or speed through aggressively to merge illegally entire section of 17th should be reduced to one lane a driver attempted to make an illegal uturn at this intersection in the course of doing so she backed up and nearly hit two pedestrians me and one other who were crossing 9th st the driver then made an obscene gesture motorists ignore the stop signs and blow through this intersection due to the increased number of apartment complexes the baseball park and the whole foods there is increased traffic in this intersection everyday when i am walk my dog or walk to the metro i see cars run or roll through the stops signs this is a school zone that is in serious need of review there isnt a cross walk to get on to school grounds causing dangerous behavior by both drivers and pedestrians there is no safe way for bikes to get to the school parents dropping young students off for elementary school are faced with treacherous street crossing conditions with sidewalks in disrepair no crosswalks and general morning traffic chaos despite schoolrelated traffic calming efforts including speed bumps and crossing guards people speed through this area children walking to the three active campuses in this area phelps 2 rivers and browne have to dodge cars to get to school with insufficient sidewalks or crosswalks there is plenty of room to build safer infrastructure for pedestrians cars frequently run the stop sign here even during school hours intersection is dangerous for pedestrians headed towards washington hospital center on michigan avenue nw at intersection of north capitol street nw vehicular traffic turning left onto north capitol from michigan do not yield with walk sign park is a one way going east to west once you reach the intersection at mt pleasant it splits into 2 i have seen many cars go in the left lane wrong direction there should be a do not enter sign poor traffic flow intersection of 17th st ne and l st ne is inaccessible for wheelchairs strollers carts bikes and pedestrians streetlights mounted on very narrow sidewalks force pedestrians toward edge of sidewalk close to the traffic speeding by street is marked 25 mph many drivers speed on 17 st ne because it is designed like a freeway add speed cameras redesign street by narrowing road and widening sidewalks and even adding bike lanes crosswalk is not marked on road at all 4 crosswalks intersection of 17th st ne and l st ne and a crosswalk light is out reporting via 311 please paintupdate crosswalk markings car often run red lights there is a left turn signal that is not well observed as i bike north through this intersection cars are turning left towards me when i have the right of way and cars are also turning right on red it is a dangerous inters the sidewalk is incredibly narrow here and the lightpole in the middle of the sidewalk prevents wheelchairs and strollers from getting through wide streets encourage aggressive driving which puts all road users at risk sidewalk on north side of k st se blocked by construction sidewalk on south side should be open but is a dirt path and constantly blocked by construction vehicles traffic control barriers personal vehicles and food trucks drivers roll through stop signs at all hours and make quick right turns knocking over the bollards that are meant to protect pedestrians cars especially delivery vehicles park in the bike lane along the east side of nj ave se despite the available driveway and loading docks forces bikers and cars into oncoming traffic going north on nj ave se drivers constantly double parked on east side of nj ave se in front of usdot there is a loading zone but it is often ignored creating bottleneck and requiring cars and bikes to filter through one lane going northbound cars park on eastbound cathedral ave adjacent to the crosswalk and intersection please install bollards to prevent parking drivers regularly drive and speed past other vehicles going way too fast in the busbikeonlyright turn lane there seems to be no police enforcement police need to enforce the bus lane westbound cyclists wishing to turn left onto the 15th street twoway cycle track are kind of left in the middle of an intersection at the mercy of oncoming cars who often cant see you well better biking infrastructure needs to be put in place here the road here is an extra lane wide because there is no tree box along the triangle park the bus has to pull over an extra lane and the wide street encourages aggressive driving please restore the tree box along this section sharp turn that discourages drivers from considering parallel bike traffic leading to right hook cutoff and incidents sharp turn that leads to drivers cutting into parallel bike lane bus drivers double parkuse the bike lane as a turning lane driver making right turn from middle lane of m street westbound onto wisconsin ave northbound during red light arrow becoming a common occurrence at this intersection 545 pm on 73119 pedestrians often headsdown on phones regularly lurch into the bike lane since there are parked cars on the other side of the bike lane they seemingly dont have the sense that they are stepping into traffic pedestrians on 15th st nw often headsdown on phones regularly lurch into the bike lane since there are parked cars on the other side of the bike lane they seemingly dont have the sense that they are stepping into traffic wh ence construction makes an already dangerous area even more condensed and crowded narrow path for cyclists to compete with tourists as well as kids on field trips who are oblivious to surroundings im just tryna get to workbike lane leads here problem area for cyclists cyclists turning all directions and already have to stress over tourists this intersection doesnt make sense cars are turning left into an intersection that has pedestrians crossing with the light because the southern section of 2nd street is closed all cars at this intersection are turning into the crosswalks cars on 11th street turning right on e capitol can only turn with a green arrow but the green arrow turns on when the pedestrian signal is on to cross e capitol this means that cars on 11th street are turning directly into pedestrian traffic potholes and narrowing road city restriped the road incorrectly and the cars now merge into the bike lane reported this to 311 and mayors office many times over last 4 months parked cars create a blind spot for their left hand turns here right hand turn is very sharp and tree blocks the view of crosswalk making it difficult for drivers to see pedestrians frequently people cut the crossing short too because the crosswalk is took long the guy who lives here drives around in a big caravan and acts like he owns the place total jerk once again this morning a driver ran a red light turning onto 6th street from pennsylvania ave my kids and i were riding our bikes on the way to their preschool and narrowly avoided being hit by an inattentive driver we need a red light camera the red light runnning at this intersection is unbelievable and there are several preschools in the area not to mention playgrounds at the park so lots of small kids around red light camera needed for 11th st se crossing nc ave the stop sign is not visible from the new hampshire ave going north about 13 of the cars run the stop sign also the cross walks are very long given the angle of the intersection they should be reduced by using poles or bump outs need 4 way stop or lite need 4 way stop need for arrows on lights for turning onto 13th st from arkansas in both direction very confusing intersection maybe 1 20 cars do not even slow down for this stop sign at least 14 slow somewhat but still roll through so quick itd be hard to classify them as rolling stops which probably nearly all other cars do jackson between 15th 16th ne has a very steep hill and it is impossible to see oncoming traffic cars parked on both sides of the road make this basically a single lane drivers routinely speed over this hill need speedbumps between 10th and puerto rico the sidewalk narrows to 2 ft or less and has been uprooted by trees keep the trees please but the sidewalks need widening and leveling widening of taylor to 4 lanes and design of this bridge encourages speeding even with an ebike going 25 mph i have been run off the road it is unsafe the short bike lane on hawaii is routinely blocked by turning traffic and large trucks at the intersection this is a very dangerous intersection way too many accidents car traveling both ways on kansas ave often traveling at high rate of speed slight hill doesnt help with visibility something has to be done about this intersection either a 4way cars heading north on 15th try to take sharp left onto new hampshire when they have a green straight arrow this is not legal their lane has a straight white arrow painted in making the turn they cut off cyclists in bike lane with green signal drivers refuse to stop at the stop sign ddot refuses to improve the signage and design mpd refuses to enforce the traffic laws sooner or later someone will be killed many speeders go through intersection '"
